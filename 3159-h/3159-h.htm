    <h2>
      PROLOGUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was very quiet within the little room perched high up under the roof of
      Wallater's Buildings. Even the glowing logs in the grate burned
      tranquilly, without any of those brisk cracklings and sputterings which
      make such cheerful company of a fire, while the distant roar of London's
      traffic came murmuringly, dulled to a gentle monotone by the honeycomb of
      narrow side streets that intervened between the gaunt, red-brick Buildings
      and the bustling highways of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed almost as though the little room were waiting for something&mdash;some
      one, just as the woman seated in the low chair at the hearthside was
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat very still, looking towards the door, her folded hands lying
      quietly on her knees in an attitude of patient expectancy. It was as if,
      although she found the waiting long and wearisome, she were yet quite sure
      she would not have to wait in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she bent forward and touched the little finger of her left hand,
      which bore, at its base, a slight circular depression such as comes from
      the constant wearing of a ring. She rubbed it softly with the forefinger
      of the other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will come," she muttered. "He promised he would come if ever I sent
      the little pearl ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she leaned back once more, resuming her former attitude of patient
      waiting, and the insistent silence, momentarily broken by her movement,
      settled down again upon the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the long rays of the westering sun crept round the edge of some
      projecting eaves and, slanting in suddenly through the window, rested upon
      the quiet figure in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in their clear, revealing light it would have been difficult to
      decide the woman's age, so worn and lined was the mask-like face outlined
      against the shabby cushion. She looked forty, yet there was something
      still girlish in the pose of her black-clad figure which seemed to suggest
      a shorter tale of years. Raven dark hair, lustreless and dull, framed a
      pale, emaciated face from which ill-health had stripped almost all that
      had once been beautiful. Only the immense dark eyes, feverishly bright
      beneath the sunken temples, and the still lovely line from jaw to pointed
      chin, remained unmarred, their beauty mocked by the pinched nostrils and
      drawn mouth, and by the scraggy, almost fleshless throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been the face of a dead woman, so still, so waxen was it,
      were it not for the eager brilliance of the eyes. In them, fixed
      watchfully upon the closed door, was concentrated the whole vitality of
      the failing body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that door, flight upon flight of some steps dropped seemingly
      endlessly one below the other, leading at last to a cement-floored
      vestibule, cheerless and uninviting, which opened on to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there was no particular reason why the vestibule should have been
      other than it was, seeing that Wallater's Buildings had not been designed
      for the habitual loiterer. For such as he there remains always the
      "luxurious entrance-hall" of hotel advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as the inhabitants of "Wallater's" were concerned, they clattered
      over the cement flooring of the vestibule in the mornings, on their way to
      work, without pausing to cast an eye of criticism upon its general aspect
      of uncomeliness, and dragged tired feet across it in an evening with no
      other thought but that of how many weary steps there were to climb before
      the room which served as "home" should be attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the well-dressed, middle-aged man who now paused, half in doubt, on
      the threshold of the Buildings, the sordid-looking vestibule, with its
      bare floor and drab-coloured walls, presented an epitome of desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His keen blue eyes, in one of which was stuck a monocle attached to a
      broad black ribbon, rested appraisingly upon the ascending spiral of the
      stone stairway that vanished into the gloomy upper reaches of the
      Building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against this chill background there suddenly took shape in his mind the
      picture of a spacious room, fragrant with the scent of roses&mdash;a room
      full of mellow tints of brown and gold, athwart which the afternoon
      sunlight lingered tenderly, picking out here the limpid blue of a bit of
      old Chinese "blue-and-white," there the warm gleam of polished copper, or
      here again the bizarre, gem-encrusted image of an Eastern god. All that
      was rare and beautiful had gone to the making of the room, and rarer and
      more beautiful than all, in the eyes of the man whose memory now recalled
      it, had been the woman to whom it had belonged, whose loveliness had
      glowed within it like a jewel in a rich setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a mental jolt his thoughts came back to the present, to the bare,
      commonplace ugliness of Wallater's Buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" he muttered. "Pauline&mdash;here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with swift steps he began the ascent of the stone steps, gradually
      slackening in pace until, when he reached the summit and stood facing that
      door behind which a woman watched and waited, he had perforce to pause to
      regain his breath, whilst certain twinges in his right knee reminded him
      that he was no longer as young as he had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to his knock a low voice bade him enter, and a minute later he
      was standing in the quiet little room, his eyes gazing levelly into the
      feverish dark ones of the woman who had risen at his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" she said, while an odd smile twisted her bloodless lips. "You have
      come, after all. Sometimes&mdash;I began to doubt if you would. It is days&mdash;an
      eternity since I sent for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been away," he replied simply. "And my mail was not forwarded. I
      came directly I received the ring&mdash;at once, as I told you I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sit down and let us talk"&mdash;impatiently&mdash;"it doesn't
      matter&mdash;nothing matters since you have come in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In time? What do you mean? In time for what? Pauline, tell me"&mdash;advancing
      a step&mdash;"tell me, in God's Name, what are you doing in this place?"
      He glanced significantly round the shabby room with its threadbare carpet
      and distempered walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm living here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Living here? You?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Why not? Soon"&mdash;indifferently&mdash;"I shall be dying here. It
      is, at least, as good a place to die in as any other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dying?" The man's pleasant baritone voice suddenly shook. "Dying? Oh, no,
      no! You've been ill&mdash;I can see that&mdash;but with care and good
      nursing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't deceive yourself, my friend," she interrupted him remorselessly.
      "See, come to the window. Now look at me&mdash;and then don't talk any
      more twaddle about care and good nursing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had drawn him towards the window, till they were standing together in
      the full blaze of the setting sun. Then she turned and faced him&mdash;a
      gaunt wreck of splendid womanhood, her fingers working nervously, whilst
      her too brilliant eyes, burning in their grey, sunken, sockets, searched
      his face curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've worn better than I have," she observed at last, breaking the
      silence with a short laugh, "you must be&mdash;let me see&mdash;fifty.
      While I'm barely thirty-one&mdash;and I look forty&mdash;and the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he reached out and gathered her thin, restless hands into his,
      holding them in a kind, firm clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!" he said sadly. "Is there nothing I can do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered steadily. "There is. And it's to ask you if you will
      do it that I sent for you. Do you suppose"&mdash;she swallowed, battling
      with the tremor in her voice&mdash;"that I <i>wanted</i> you to see me&mdash;as
      I am now? It was months&mdash;months before I could bring myself to send
      you the little pearl ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed one of the hands he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, foolish woman! You would always be&mdash;just Pauline&mdash;to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes softened suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you never married, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened his shoulders, meeting her glance squarely&mdash;almost
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you imagine that I should?" he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, I suppose not." She looked away. "What a mess I made of things,
      didn't I? However, it's all past now; the game's nearly over, thank
      Heaven! Life, since that day"&mdash;the eyes of the man and woman met
      again in swift understanding&mdash;"has been one long hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He&mdash;the man you married&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Made that hell. I left him after six years of it, taking the child with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The child?" A curious expression came into his eyes, resentful, yet
      tinged at the same time with an oddly tender interest. "Was there a
      child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;I have a little daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did your husband never trace you?" he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He never tried to"&mdash;grimly. "Afterwards&mdash;well, it was downhill
      all the way. I didn't know how to work, and by that time I had learned my
      health was going. Since then, I've lived on the proceeds of the pawnshop&mdash;I
      had my jewels, you know&mdash;and on the odd bits of money I could scrape
      together by taking in sewing."
    </p>
    <p>
      A groan burst from the man's dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God!" he cried. "Pauline, Pauline, it was cruel of you to keep me
      in ignorance! I could at least have helped."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't take&mdash;<i>your</i> money," she said quietly. "I was too
      proud for that. But, dear friend"&mdash;as she saw him wince&mdash;"I'm
      not proud any longer. I think Death very soon shows us how little&mdash;pride&mdash;matters;
      it falls into its right perspective when one is nearing the end of things.
      I'm so little proud now that I've sent for you to ask your help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything&mdash;anything!" he said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather a big thing that I'm going to ask, I'm afraid. I want you,"
      she spoke slowly, as though to focus his attention, "to take care of my
      child&mdash;when I am gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But her father? Will he consent?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead. I received the news of his death six months ago. There is no
      one&mdash;no one who has any claim upon her. And no one upon whom she has
      any claim, poor little atom!"&mdash;smiling rather bitterly. "Ah! Don't
      deny me!"&mdash;her thin, eager hands clung to his&mdash;"don't deny me&mdash;say
      that you'll take her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deny you? But, of course I shan't deny you. I'm only thankful that you
      have turned to me at last&mdash;that you have not quite forgotten!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgotten?" Her voice vibrated. "Believe me or not, as you will, there
      has never been a day for nine long years when I have not remembered&mdash;never
      a night when I have not prayed God to bless you&mdash;&mdash;" She broke
      off, her mouth working uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly, very tenderly, he drew her into his arms. There was no
      passion in the caress&mdash;for was it not eventide, and the lengthening
      shadows of night already fallen across her path?&mdash;but there was
      infinite love, and forgiveness, and understanding. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, may I see her&mdash;the little daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight had gathered about them during that quiet hour of reunion,
      wherein old hurts had been healed, old sins forgiven, and now at last they
      had come back together out of the past to the recognition of all that yet
      remained to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a sound of running footsteps on the stairs outside&mdash;light,
      eager steps, buoyant with youth, that evidently found no hardship in the
      long ascent from the street level.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark!" The woman paused, her head a little turned to listen. "Here she
      comes. No one else on this floor"&mdash;with a whimsical smile&mdash;"could
      take the last flight of those awful stairs at a run."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door flew open, and the man received an impressionist picture of which
      the salient features were a mop of black hair, a scarlet jersey, and a
      pair of abnormally long black legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door closed with a bang, and the blur of black and scarlet
      resolved itself into a thin, eager-faced child of eight, who paused
      irresolutely upon perceiving a stranger in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, kiddy," the woman held out her hand. "This"&mdash;and her eyes
      sought those of the man as though beseeching confirmation&mdash;"is your
      uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child advanced and shook hands politely, then stood still, staring at
      this unexpectedly acquired relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sharp-pointed face was so thin and small that her eyes, beneath their
      straight, dark brows, seemed to be enormous&mdash;black, sombre eyes,
      having no kinship with the intense, opaque brown so frequently miscalled
      black, but suggestive of the vibrating darkness of night itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively the man's glance wandered to the face of the child's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think her like me?" she hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very like you," he assented gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wry smile wrung her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope that the likeness is only skin-deep, then!" she said
      bitterly. "I don't want her life to be&mdash;as mine has been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," he said gently, "if you will trust her to me, Pauline, I swear to
      you that I will do all in my power to save her from&mdash;what you've
      suffered."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all a matter of character," she said nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he agreed simply. Then he turned to the child, who was standing a
      little distance away from him, eyeing him distrustfully. "What do you say,
      child! You wouldn't be afraid to come and live with me, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am never afraid of people," she answered promptly. "Except the man who
      comes for the rent; he is fat, and red, and a beast. But I'd rather go on
      living with Mumsy, thank you&mdash;Uncle." The designation came after a
      brief hesitation. "You see," she added politely, as though fearful that
      she might have hurt his feelings, "we've always lived together." She flung
      a glance of almost passionate adoration at her mother, who turned towards
      the man, smiling a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see how it is with her?" she said. "She lives by her affections&mdash;conversely
      from her mother, her heart rules her head. You will be gentle with her,
      won't you, when the wrench comes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said, taking her hand in his and speaking with the quiet
      solemnity of a man who vows himself before some holy altar, "I shall never
      forget that she is your child&mdash;the child of the woman I love."

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MORNING ADVENTURE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The dewy softness of early morning still hung about the woods, veiling
      their autumn tints in broken, drifting swathes of pearly mist, while
      towards the east, where the rising sun pushed long, dim fingers of light
      into the murky greyness of the sky, a tremulous golden haze grew and
      deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little, delicate twitterings vibrated on the air&mdash;the sleepy chirrup
      of awakening birds, the rustle of a fallen leaf beneath the pad of some
      belated cat stealing back to the domestic hearth, the stir of a rabbit in
      its burrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently these sank into insignificance beside a more definite sound&mdash;the
      crackle of dry leaves and the snapping of twigs beneath a heavier footfall
      than that of any marauding Tom, and through a clearing in the woods
      slouched the figure of a man, gun on shoulder, the secret of his bulging
      side-pockets betrayed by the protruding tail feathers of a cock-pheasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not an attractive specimen of mankind. Beneath the peaked cap,
      crammed well down on to his head, gleamed a pair of surly, watchful eyes,
      and, beneath these again, the unshaven, brutal, out-thrust jaw offered
      little promise of better things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did his appearance in any way belie his reputation, which was unsavory
      in the extreme. Indeed, if report spoke truly, "Black Brady," as he was
      commonly called, had on one occasion only escaped the gallows thanks to
      the evidence of a village girl&mdash;one who had loved him recklessly, to
      her own undoing. Every one had believed her evidence to be false, but, as
      she had stuck to what she said through thick and thin, and as no amount of
      cross-examination had been able to shake her, Brady had contrived to slip
      through the hands of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceiving, however, that, after this episode, the air of his native place
      might prove somewhat insalubrious for a time, he had migrated thence to
      Fallowdene, establishing himself in a cottage on the outskirts of the
      village and finding the major portion of his sustenance by skillfully
      poaching the preserves of the principal landowners of the surrounding
      district.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular morning he was well content with his night's work. He
      had raided the covers of one Patrick Lovell, the owner of Barrow Court,
      who, although himself a confirmed invalid and debarred from all manner of
      sport, employed two or three objectionably lynx-eyed keepers to safeguard
      his preserves for the benefit of his heirs and assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      No covers were better stocked than those of Barrow Court, but Brady rarely
      risked replenishing his larder from them, owing to the extreme
      wideawakeness of the head gamekeeper. It was therefore not without a warm
      glow of satisfaction about the region of his heart that he made his way
      homeward through the early morning, reflecting on the ease with which last
      night's marauding expedition had been conducted. He even pursed his lips
      together and whistled softly&mdash;a low, flute-like sound that might
      almost have been mistaken for the note of a blackbird.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is unwise to whistle before you are out of the wood, and Brady's
      triumph was short-lived. Swift as a shadow, a lithe figure darted out from
      among the trees and planted itself directly in his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      With equal swiftness, Brady brought his gunstock to his shoulder. Then he
      hesitated, finger on trigger, for the lion in his path was no burly
      gamekeeper, as, for the first moment, he had supposed. It was a woman who
      faced him&mdash;a mere girl of twenty, whose slender figure looked somehow
      boyish in its knitted sports coat and very short, workmanlike skirt. The
      suggestion of boyishness was emphasized by her attitude, as she stood
      squarely planted in front of Black Brady, her hands thrust deep into her
      pockets, her straight young back very flat, and her head a little tilted,
      so that her eyes might search the surly face beneath the peaked cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were arresting eyes&mdash;amazingly dark, "like two patches o' the
      sky be night," as Brady described them long afterwards to a crony of his,
      and they gazed up at the astonished poacher from a small, sharply angled
      face, as delicately cut as a cameo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put that gun down!" commanded an imperious young voice, a voice that held
      something indescribably sweet and thrilling in its vibrant quality. "What
      are you doing in these woods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brady, recovering from his first surprise, lowered his gun, but answered
      truculently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you mind what I'm doin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl pointed significantly to his distended pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't need to ask. Empty out your pockets and take yourself off. Do you
      hear?" she added sharply, as the man made no movement to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't do nothin' o' the sort," he growled. "You go your ways and leave
      me to go mine&mdash;or it'll be the worse for 'ee." He raised his gun
      threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not in the least afraid of that gun," she said tranquilly. "But you
      are afraid to use it," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" He wheeled suddenly, and, on the instant, a deafening report
      shattered the quiet of the woods. Then the smoke drifted slowly aside,
      revealing the man and the girl face to face once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although she still stood her ground, dark shadows had suddenly painted
      themselves beneath her eyes, and the slight young breast beneath the
      jaunty sports coat rose and fell unevenly. Within the shelter of her
      coat-pockets her hands were clenched tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a waste of a good cartridge," she observed quietly. "You only
      fired in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Brady glared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I'd liked, I could 'ave killed 'ee as easy as knockin' a bird off a
      bough," he said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could," she agreed. "And then I should have been dead and you would
      have been waiting for a hanging. Of the two, I think my position would
      have been the more comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of unwilling admiration spread itself slowly over the man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You be a cool 'and, and no mistake," he acknowledged. "I thought to
      frighten you off by firin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as you haven't, suppose you allow that I've won and that it's up to
      me to dictate terms. If my uncle were to see you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not comin' up to the house&mdash;don't you think it, win or no win,"
      broke in Brady hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl regarded him judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think we particularly want you up at the house," she remarked.
      "If you'll do as I say&mdash;empty your pockets&mdash;you may go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man reluctantly made as though to obey, but even while he hesitated,
      he saw the girl's eyes suddenly look past him, over his shoulder, and,
      turning suspiciously, he swung straight into the brawny grip of the head
      keeper, who, hearing a shot fired, had deserted his breakfast and hurried
      in the direction of the sound and now came up close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caught this time, Brady, my man," chuckled the keeper triumphantly. "It's
      gaol for you this journey, as sure's my name's Clegg. Has the fellow been
      annoying you, Miss Sara?" he added, touching his hat respectfully as he
      turned towards the girl, whilst with his other hand he still retained his
      grip of Brady's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as though suddenly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to speak of, Clegg," she replied. "And I'm afraid you mustn't
      send him to prison this time. I told him if he would empty his pockets he
      might go. That still holds good," she added, looking towards Brady, who
      flashed her a quick look of gratitude from beneath his heavy brows and
      proceeded to turn out the contents of his pockets with commendable
      celerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the keeper protested against the idea of releasing his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a fair cop, miss," he urged entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't help it, Clegg. I promised. So you must let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man obeyed with obvious reluctance. Then, when Brady had hastened to
      make himself scarce, he turned and scrutinized the girl curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You all right, Miss Sara? Shall I see you up to the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks, Clegg," she said. "I'm&mdash;I'm quite all right. You can go
      back to your breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, miss." He touched his hat and plunged back again into the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood still, looking after him. She was rather white, but she
      remained very erect and taut until the keeper had disappeared from view.
      Then the tense rigidity of her figure slackened, as a stretched wire
      slackens when the pull on it suddenly ceases, and she leaned helpless
      against the trunk of a tree, limp and shaking, every fine-strung nerve
      ajar with the strain of her recent encounter with Black Brady. As she felt
      her knees giving way weakly beneath her, a dogged little smile twisted her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a cool 'and, and no mistake," she whispered shakily, an ironical
      gleam flickering in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She propped herself up against the friendly tree, and, after a few
      minutes, the quick throbbing of her heard steadied down and the colour
      began to steal back into her lips. At length she stooped, and, picking up
      her hat, which had fallen off and lay on the ground at her feet, she
      proceeded to make her way through the woods in the direction of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow Court, as the name implied, was situated on the brow of a hill,
      sheltered from the north and easterly winds by a thick belt of pines which
      half-encircled it, for ever murmuring and whispering together as
      pine-trees will.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Sara Tennant, the soft, sibilant noise was a beloved and familiar
      sound. From the first moment when, as a child, she had come to live at
      Barrow, the insistent murmur of the pines had held an extraordinary
      fascination for her. That, and their pungent scent, seemed to be
      interwoven with her whole life there, like the thread of some single
      colour that persists throughout the length of a woven fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been desperately miserable and lonely at the time of her advent at
      the Court; and all through the long, wakeful vigil of her first night, it
      had seemed to her vivid, childish imagination as though the big, swaying
      trees, bleakly etched against the moonlit sky, had understood her
      desolation and had whispered and crooned consolingly outside her window.
      Since then, she had learned that the voice of the pines, like the voice of
      the sea, is always pitched in a key that responds to the mood of the
      listener. If you chance to be glad, then the pines will whisper of
      sunshine and summer, little love idylls that one tree tells to another,
      but if your heart is heavy within you, you will hear only a dirge in the
      hush of their waving tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sara emerged from the shelter of the woods, her eyes instinctively
      sought the great belt of trees that crowned the opposite hill, with the
      grey bulk of the house standing out in sharp relief against their eternal
      green. A little smile of pure pleasure flitted across her face; to her
      there was something lovable and rather charming about the very
      architectural inconsistencies which prevented Barrow Court from being, in
      any sense of the word, a show place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central portion of the house, was comparatively modern, built of stone
      in solid Georgian fashion, but quaintly flanked at either end by a
      massive, mediaeval tower, survival of the good old days when the Lovells
      of Fallowdene had held their own against all comers, not even excepting,
      in the case of one Roderic, his liege lord and master the King, the latter
      having conceived a not entirely unprovoked desire to deprive him of his
      lands and liberty&mdash;a desire destined, however, to be frustrated by
      the solid masonry of Barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flagged terrace ran the whole length of the long, two-storied house,
      broadening out into wide wings at the base of either tower, and, below the
      terrace, green, shaven lawns, dotted with old yew, sloped down to the edge
      of a natural lake which lay in the hollow of the valley, gleaming like a
      sheet of silver in the morning sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prim walks, bordered by high box hedges, intersected the carefully tended
      gardens, and along one of these Sara took her way, quickening her steps to
      a run as the booming summons of a gong suddenly reverberated on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the house, flushed and a little breathless, and, tossing aside
      her hat as she sped through the big, oak-beamed hall, hurried into a
      pleasant, sunshiny room, where a couple of menservants were moving quietly
      about, putting the finishing touches to the breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invalid's wheeled chair stood close to the open window, and in it, with
      a rug tucked about his knees, was seated an elderly man of some sixty-two
      or three years of age. He was leaning forward, giving animated
      instructions to a gardener who listened attentively from the terrace
      outside, and his alert, eager, manner contrasted oddly with the
      helplessness of limb indicated by the necessity for the wheeled chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all, Digby," he said briskly. "I'll go through the hot-houses
      myself some time to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he signed to one of the footmen in the room to close the
      window, and then propelled his chair with amazing rapidity to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant and careful attention accorded to his commands by both
      gardener and servant was characteristic of every one in Patrick Lovell's
      employment. Although he had been a more or less helpless invalid for seven
      years, he had never lost his grip of things. He was exactly as much master
      of Barrow Court, the dominant factor there, as he had been in the good
      times that were gone, when no day's shooting had been too long for him, no
      run with hounds too fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat very erect in his wheeled chair, a handsome, well-groomed old
      aristocrat. Clean-shaven, except for a short, carefully trimmed moustache,
      grizzled like his hair, his skin exhibited the waxen pallor which so often
      accompanies chronic ill-health, and his face was furrowed by deep lines,
      making him look older than his sixty-odd years. His vivid blue eyes were
      extraordinarily keen and penetrating; possibly they, and the determined,
      squarish jaw, were answerable for that unquestioning obedience which was
      invariably accorded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, uncle mine!" Sara bent to kiss him as the door closed
      quietly behind the retreating servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick Lovell screwed his monocle into his eye and regarded her
      dispassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look somewhat ruffled," he observed, "both literally and
      figuratively."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, putting up a careless hand to brush back the heavy tress of
      dark hair that had fallen forward over her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had an adventure," she answered, and proceeded to recount her
      experience with Black Brady. When she reached the point where the man had
      fired off his gun, Patrick interrupted explosively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The infernal scoundrel! That fellow will dangle at the end of a rope one
      of these days&mdash;and deserve it, too. He's a murderous ruffian&mdash;a
      menace to the countryside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He only fired into the air&mdash;to frighten me," explained Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did he succeed?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bestowed a little grin of understanding upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did," she averred gravely. Then, as Patrick's bushy eyebrows came
      together in a bristling frown, she added: "But he remained in ignorance of
      the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      The frown was replaced by a twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, then," came the contented answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, I really <i>was</i> frightened," she persisted. "It gave me
      quite a nasty turn, as the servants say. I don't think"&mdash;meditatively&mdash;"that
      I enjoy being shot at. Am I a funk, my uncle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my niece"&mdash;with some amusement. "On the contrary, I should
      define the highest type of courage as self-control in the presence of
      danger&mdash;not necessarily absence of fear. The latter is really no more
      credit to you than eating your dinner when you're hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine, then, I perceive to be the highest type of courage," chuckled Sara.
      "It's a comforting reflection."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, when propounded by Patrick Lovell, to whom physical fear was an
      unknown quantity. Had he lived in the days of the Terror, he would
      assuredly have taken his way to the guillotine with the same gay, debonair
      courage which enabled the nobles of France to throw down their cards and
      go to the scaffold with a smiling promise to the other players that they
      would continue their interrupted game in the next world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Sara had come to live with Patrick, a dozen years ago, he had
      rigorously inculcated in her youthful mind a contempt for every form of
      cowardice, moral and physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not been all plain sailing, for Sara was a highly strung child,
      with the vivid imagination that is the primary cause of so much that is
      carelessly designated cowardice. But Patrick had been very wise in his
      methods. He had never rebuked her for lack of courage; he had simply taken
      it for granted that she would keep her grip of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's thoughts slid back to an incident which had occurred during their
      early days together. She had been very much alarmed by the appearance of a
      huge mastiff who was permitted the run of the house, and her uncle,
      noticing her shrinking avoidance of the rather formidable looking beast,
      had composedly bidden her take him to the stables and chain him up. For an
      instant the child had hesitated. Then, something in the man's quiet
      confidence that she would obey had made its claim on her childish pride,
      and, although white to the lips, she had walked straight up to the great
      creature, hooked her small fingers into his collar, and marched him off to
      his kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage under physical pain she had learned from seeing Patrick contend
      with his own infirmity. He suffered intensely at times, but neither groan
      nor word of complaint was ever allowed to escape his set lips. Only Sara
      would see, after what he described as "one of my damn bad days, m'dear,"
      new lines added to the deepening network that had so aged his appearance
      lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these times she herself endured agonies of reflex suffering and
      apprehension, since her attachment to Patrick Lovell was the moving factor
      of her existence. Other girls had parents, brothers and sisters, and still
      more distant relatives upon whom their capacity for loving might severally
      expend itself. Sara had none of these, and the whole devotion of her
      intensely ardent nature lavished itself upon the man whom she called
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mutual attitude was something more than the accepted relationship
      implied. They were friends&mdash;these two&mdash;intimate friends,
      comrades on an equal footing, respecting each other's reserves and
      staunchly loyal to one another. Perhaps this was accounted for in a
      measure by the very fact that they were united by no actual bond of blood.
      That Sara was Patrick's niece by adoption was all the explanation of her
      presence at Barrow Court that he had ever vouchsafed to the world in
      general, and it practically amounted to the sum total of Sara's own
      knowledge of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hers had been a life of few relationships. She had no recollection of any
      one who had ever stood towards her in the position of a father, and though
      she realized that the one-time existence of such a personage must be
      assumed, she had never felt much curiosity concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horizon of her earliest childhood had held but one figure, that of an
      adored mother, and "home" had been represented by a couple of meager rooms
      at the top of a big warren of a place known as Wallater's Buildings,
      tenanted principally by families of the artisan class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus debarred by circumstances from the companionship of other children,
      Sara's whole affections had centred round her mother, and she had never
      forgotten the sheer, desolating anguish of that moment when the dreadful,
      unresponsive silence of the sheeted figure, lying in the shabby little
      bedroom they had shared together, brought home to her the significance of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not cried, as most children of eight would have done, but she had
      suffered in a kind of frozen silence, incapable of any outward expression
      of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfeelin', I call it!" declared the woman who lived on the same floor as
      the Tennants, and who had attended at the doctor's behest, to a friend and
      neighbour who was occupied in boiling a kettle over a gas-ring. "Must be a
      cold-'earted child as can see 'er own mother lyin' dead without so much as
      a tear." She sniffed. "'Aven't you got that cup o' tea ready yet? I can
      allus drink a cup o' tea after a layin'-out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara had watched the two women drinking their tea with brooding eyes, her
      small breast heaving with the intensity of her resentment. Without being
      in any way able to define her emotions, she felt that there was something
      horrible in their frank enjoyment of the steaming liquid, gulped down to
      the cheerful accompaniment of a running stream of intimate gossip, while
      all the time that quiet figure lay on the narrow bed&mdash;motionless,
      silent, wrapped in the strange and immense aloofness of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently one of the women poured out a third cup of tea and pushed it
      towards the child, slopping in the thin, bluish-looking milk with a
      generous hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ave a cup, child. It's as good a drop o' tea as ever I tasted."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Sara stared at her speechlessly; then, with a sudden
      passionate gesture, she swept the cup on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clash of breaking china seemed to ring through the chamber of death,
      the women's voices rose shrilly in reproof, and Sara, fleeing into the
      adjoining room, cast herself face downwards upon the floor,
      horror-stricken. It was not the raucous anger of the women which she
      heeded; that passed her by. But she had outraged some fine, instinctive
      sense by reverence that lay deep within her own small soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not cry. Only, as she lay on the ground with her face
      hidden, she kept repeating in a tense whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I didn't mean it, God! You know I didn't mean it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Patrick Lovell had appeared, coming in response to she
      knew not what summons, and had taken her away with him. And the tendrils
      of her affection, wrenched from their accustomed hold, had twined
      themselves about this grey-haired, blue-eyed man, set so apart by every <i>soigné</i>
      detail of his person from the shabby, slip-shod world which Sara had
      known, but who yet stood beside the bed on which her mother lay, with a
      wrung mouth beneath his clipped moustache and a mist of tears dimming his
      keen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara had loved him for those tears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PASSING OF PATRICK LOVELL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Autumn had given place to winter, and a bitter northeast wind was tearing
      through the pines, shrieking, as it fled, like the cry of a lost soul. The
      eerie sound of it served in some indefinable way to emphasise the cosy
      warmth and security of the room where Sara and her uncle were sitting,
      their chairs drawn close up to the log fire which burned on the wide,
      old-fashioned hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was engrossed in a book, her head bent low above its pages,
      unconscious of the keen blue eyes that had been regarding her reflectively
      for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the passage of the last two months, Patrick's face seemed to have
      grown more waxen, worn a little finer, and now, as he sat quietly watching
      the slender figure on the opposite side of the hearth, it wore a curious,
      inscrutable expression, as though he were mentally balancing the pros and
      cons of some knotty point.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he apparently came to a decision, for he laid aside the newspaper
      he had been reading a few moments before, muttering half audibly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must take your fences as you come to 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked up abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you say anything?" she asked doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick gave his shoulders a grim shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to," he replied. "It's something that must be said, and, as
      I've never been in favour of postponing a thing just because its
      disagreeable, we may as well get it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had focused Sara's attention unmistakably now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" she asked quickly. "You haven't had bad news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd smile crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary." He hesitated a moment, then continued: "I had a longish
      talk with Dr. McPherson yesterday, and the upshot of it is that I may be
      required to hand in my checks any day now. I wanted you to know," he added
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the understanding between these two that Patrick
      made no effort to "break the news," or soften it in any way. He had always
      been prepared to face facts himself, and he had trained Sara in the same
      stern creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that now, when he quietly stated in plain language the thing which she
      had been inwardly dreading for some weeks&mdash;for, though silent on the
      matter, she had not failed to observe his appearance of increasing frailty&mdash;she
      took it like a thorough-bred. Her eyes dilated a little, but her voice was
      quite steady as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that before very long I shall put off this vile body." He glanced
      down whimsically at his useless legs, cloaked beneath the inevitable rug.
      "After all," he continued, "life&mdash;and death&mdash;are both fearfully
      interesting if one only goes to meet them instead of running away from
      them. Then they become bogies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what shall I do . . . without you?" she said very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye." He nodded. "It's worse for those who are left behind. I've been one
      of them, and I know. I remember&mdash;" He broke off short, his blue eyes
      dreaming. Presently he gave his shoulders the characteristic little shake
      which presaged the dismissal of some recalcitrant secret thought, and went
      on in quick, practical tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to go out leaving a lot of loose ends behind me&mdash;a
      tangle for you to unravel. So, since the fiat has gone forth&mdash;McPherson's
      a sound man and knows his job&mdash;let's face it together, little old
      pal. It will mean your leaving Barrow, you know," he added tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded, her face rather white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. I shan't care&mdash;then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you will"&mdash;with shrewd wisdom. "It will be an extra drop in
      the bucket, you'll find, when the time comes. Unfortunately, however,
      there's no getting round the entail, and when I go, my cousin, Major
      Durward, will reign in my stead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does the Court go to a Durward?" asked Sara listlessly. "Aren't there
      any Lovells to inherit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a Lovell. His father and mine were brothers, but his godfather, old
      Timothy Durward left him his property on condition that he adopted the
      name. Geoffrey Durward has a son called Timothy&mdash;after the old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Durwards have never been here since I came to live with you,"
      observed Sara thoughtfully. "Don't you care for him&mdash;your cousin, I
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Geoffrey? Yes, he's a charming fellow, and he's been a rattling good
      soldier&mdash;got his D.S.O. in the South African campaign. But he and his
      wife&mdash;she was a Miss Eden&mdash;were stationed in India so many
      years, I rather lost touch with them. They came home when the Durward
      property fell in to them&mdash;about seven or eight years ago. She, I
      think"&mdash;reminiscently&mdash;"was one of the most beautiful women I've
      ever seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow in Sara's eyes lifted for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the reason you've always remained a bachelor?" she asked,
      twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless my soul, no! I never wanted to marry Elisabeth Eden&mdash;though
      there were plenty of men who did." He regarded Sara with an odd smile.
      "Some day, you'll know&mdash;why I never wanted to marry Elisabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You'll know soon enough&mdash;soon enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, fallen a-dreaming once again; and again he seemed to pull
      himself up short, forcing himself back to the consideration of the
      practical needs of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I was saying, Sara, sooner or later you'll have to turn out of the old
      Court. It's entailed, and the income with it. But I've a clear four
      hundred a year, altogether apart from the Barrow moneys, and that, at my
      death, will be yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to hear about it!" burst out Sara passionately. "It's
      hateful even talking of such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick smiled, amused and a little touched by youth's lack of worldly
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a fool, my dear. I shan't die a day sooner for having made my
      will&mdash;and I shall die a deal more comfortably, knowing that you are
      provided for. I promised your mother that, as far as lay in my power, I
      would shield you from wrecking your life as she wrecked hers. And money&mdash;a
      secure little income of her own&mdash;is a very good sort of shield for a
      women. Four hundred's not enough to satisfy a mercenary individual, but
      it's enough to enable a woman to marry for love&mdash;and not for a home!"
      He spoke with a kind of repressed bitterness, as though memory had stirred
      into fresh flame the embers of some burnt-out passion of regret, and Sara
      looked at him with suddenly aroused interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apparently Patrick did not sense the question that troubled on her
      lips, or, if he did, had no mind to answer it, for he went on in lighter
      tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, that's enough about business for the present. I only wanted you to
      know that, whatever happens, you will be all right as far as
      bread-and-cheese are concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you think that's all I should care about!" exclaimed Sara
      stormily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick smiled. He had not been a citizen of the world for over sixty
      years without acquiring the grim knowledge that neither intense happiness
      nor deep grief suffice to deaden for very long the pinpricks of material
      discomfort. But the worldly-wise old man possessed a broad tolerance for
      the frailties of human nature, and his smile held nothing of contempt, but
      only a whimsical humour touched with kindly understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you better than that, my dear," he answered quietly. "But I often
      think of what I once heard an old working-woman, down in the village, say.
      She had just lost her husband, and the rector's wife was handing out the
      usual platitudes, and holding forth on the example of Christian fortitude
      exhibited by a very wealthy lady in the neighbourhood, who had also been
      recently widowed. 'That's all very well, ma'am,' said my old woman drily,
      'but fat sorrow's a deal easier to bear than lean sorrow.' And though it
      may sound unromantic, it's the raw truth&mdash;only very few people are
      sincere enough to acknowledge it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the weeks that followed, Patrick seemed to recover a large measure of
      his accustomed vigour. He was extraordinarily alert and cheerful&mdash;so
      <i>alive</i> that Sara began to hope Dr. McPherson had been mistaken in
      his opinion, and that there might yet remain many more good years of the
      happy comradeship that existed between herself and her guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such buoyancy appeared incompatible with the imminence of death, and one
      day, driven by the very human instinct to hear her optimism endorsed, she
      scoffed a little, tentatively, at the doctor's verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, he's right," he said decisively. "But I'm not going to whine
      about it. Taken all round, I've found life a very good sort of thing&mdash;although"&mdash;reflectively&mdash;"I've
      missed the best it has to offer a man. And probably I'll find death a very
      good sort of thing, too, when it comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Patrick Lovell went forward, his spirit erect, to meet death with
      the same cheerful, half-humorous courage he had opposed to the emergencies
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a few days after this, on Christmas Eve, that Sara, coming into his
      special den with a gay little joke on her lips and a great bunch of
      mistletoe in her arms, was arrested by the sudden, chill quiet of the
      little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar wheeled chair was drawn up to the window, and she could see
      the back of Patrick's head with its thick crop of grizzled hair, but he
      did not turn or speak at the sound of her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle, didn't you hear me? Are you asleep? . . . <i>Uncle!</i>" Her voice
      shrilled on to a sharp staccato note, then cracked and broke suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no movement from the chair. The silence remained unbroken save
      for the ticking of a clock and the loud beating of her own heart. The two
      seemed to merge into one gigantic pulse . . . deafening . . . overwhelming
      . . . like the surge of some immense, implacable sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She swayed a little, clutching at the door for support. Then the throbbing
      ceased, and she was only conscious of a solitude so intense that it seemed
      to press about her like a tangible thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly, on feet of terror, she crossed the room and stood looking down at
      the motionless figure of her uncle. His face was turned towards the sun,
      and wore an expression of complete happiness and content, as though he had
      just found something for which he had been searching. He had looked like
      that a thousand times, when, seeking for her, he had come upon her, at
      last, hidden in some shady nook in the garden or swinging in her hammock.
      She could almost hear the familiar "Oh, there you are, little pal!" with
      which he would joyously acclaim her discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the hand that was resting quietly on his knee. It lay in hers,
      flaccid and inert, its dreadful passivity stinging her into realization of
      the truth. Patrick was dead. And, judging from his expression, he had
      found death "a very good sort of thing," just as he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while Sara remained standing quietly beside the still figure
      in the chair. They would never be alone together any more&mdash;not quite
      like this, Patrick sitting in his accustomed place, wearing his beloved
      old tweeds, with an immaculate tie and with his single eyeglass&mdash;about
      which she had so often chaffed him&mdash;dangling across his chest on its
      black ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth quivered. "Stand up to it!" . . . The voice&mdash;Patrick's
      voice&mdash;seemed to sound in her ear . . . "Stand up to it, little old
      pal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit back the sob that climbed to her throat, and stood silently facing
      the enemy, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the end, then, of one chapter of her existence&mdash;the chapter
      of sheltered, happy life at Barrow, and in these quiet moments, alone for
      the last time with Patrick Lovell, Sara tried to gather strength and
      courage from her memories of his cheery optimism to face gamely whatever
      might befall her in the big world into which she must so soon adventure.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A SHEAF OF MEMORIES
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was over. The master of Barrow had been carried shoulder-high to the
      great vault where countless Lovells slept their last sleep, the blinds had
      been drawn up, letting in the wintry sunlight once again, and the mourners
      had gone their ways. Only the new owner of the Court still lingered, and
      even he would be leaving very soon now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, her slim, boyish build, with its long line of slender hip,
      accentuated by the clinging black of her gown, moved listlessly across the
      hall to where Major Durward was standing smoking by the big open fire,
      waiting for the car which was to take him to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made as though to throw his cigarette away at her approach, but she
      gestured a hasty negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't," she said. "I like it. It seems to make things a little more
      natural. Uncle Pat"&mdash;with a wan smile&mdash;"was always smoking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sombre eyes were shadowed and sad, and there was a pinched, drawn look
      about her nostrils. Major Durward regarded her with a concerned expression
      on his kindly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will miss him badly," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I shall miss him,"&mdash;simply. She returned his glance frankly.
      "You are very like him, you know," she added suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. The big, soldierly man beside her, with his jolly blue eyes,
      grey hair, and short-clipped military moustache, bore a striking
      resemblance to the Patrick Lovell of ten years ago, before ill-health had
      laid its finger upon him, and during the difficult days that succeeded her
      uncle's death Sara had unconsciously found a strange kind of comfort in
      the likeness. She had dreaded inexpressibly the advent of the future owner
      of Barrow, but, when he had arrived, his resemblance to his dead cousin,
      and a certain similarity of gesture and of voice, common enough in
      families, had at once established a sense of kinship, which had deepened
      with her recognition of Durward's genuine kind-heartedness and solicitude
      for her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had immediately assumed control of affairs, taking all the inevitable
      detail of arrangement off her shoulders, yet deferring to her as though
      she were still just as much mistress of the Court as she had been before
      her uncle's death. In every way he had tried to ease and smooth matters
      for her, and she felt proportionately grateful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you think I'm like him," said Durward gently, "will you let me
      try to take his place a little? I mean," he explained hastily, fearing she
      might misunderstand him, "that you will miss his guardianship and care of
      you, as well as the good pal you found in him. Will you let me try to fill
      in the gaps, if&mdash;if you should want advice, or service&mdash;anything
      over which a male man can be a bit useful? Oh&mdash;&mdash;" breaking off
      with a short, embarrassed laugh&mdash;"it is so difficult to explain what
      I do mean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know," said Sara, smiling faintly. "You mean that now that
      Uncle Pat has gone, you don't want me to feel quite adrift in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      The big man, hampered by his masculine shyness of a difficult situation,
      smiled back at her, relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it, that's it!" he agreed eagerly. "I want you to regard me
      as a&mdash;a sort of sheet-anchor upon which you can pull in a storm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Sara. "I will. But I hope there won't be storms of such
      magnitude that I shall need to pull very hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Durward smoked furiously for a moment. Then he burst forth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't imagine what a brute I feel for turning you out of the Court. I
      wish it need not be. But the Lovells have always lived at the old place,
      and my wife&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally." She interrupted him gently. "Naturally, she wishes to live
      here. I owe you no grudge for that," smiling. "When&mdash;how soon do you
      think of coming? I will make my arrangements accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should like to come as soon as possible, really," he admitted
      reluctantly. "I have the chance of leasing Durward Park, if the tenant can
      have what practically amounts to immediate possession. And of course, in
      the circumstances, I should be glad to get the Durward property off my
      hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you would." Sara nodded understandingly. "If you could let me
      have a few days in which to find some rooms&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," he broke in eagerly. "I want you still to regard Barrow as your
      headquarters&mdash;to stay on here with us until you have fixed some
      permanent arrangement that suits you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was touched by the kindly suggestion; nevertheless, she shook her head
      with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is more than kind of you to think of such a thing," she said
      gratefully. "But it is quite out of the question. Why, I am not even a
      cousin several times removed! I have no claim at all. Mrs. Durward&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will be delighted. She asked me to be sure and tell you so. Please, Miss
      Tennant, don't refuse me. Don't"&mdash;persuasively&mdash;"oblige us to
      feel more brutal interlopers than we need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were sure&mdash;" she began doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be&mdash;absolutely sure. There!"&mdash;with a sigh of relief&mdash;"that's
      settled. But, as I can see you're the kind of person whose conscientious
      scruples will begin to worry you the moment I'm gone"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"my
      wife will write to you. Promise not to run away in the meantime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise," said Sara. She held out her hand. "And&mdash;thank you." Her
      eyes, suddenly misty, supplemented the baldness of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the outstretched hand in a close, friendly grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. That's the car, I think," as the even purring of a motor sounded
      from outside. "I must be off. But it's only <i>au revoir</i>, remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked with him to the door, and stood watching until the car was lost
      in sight round a bend of the drive. Then, as she turned back into the
      hall, the emptiness of the house seemed to close down about her all at
      once, like a pall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the manifold duties and emergencies of the last few days she had
      hardly had time to realize the immensity of her loss. Practical matters
      had forcibly obtruded themselves upon her consideration&mdash;the
      necessity of providing accommodation for the various relatives who had
      attended the funeral, the frequent consultations that Major Durward, to
      all intents and purposes a stranger to the ways of Barrow, had been
      obliged to hold with her, the reading of the will&mdash;all these had
      combined to keep her in a state of mental and physical alertness which had
      mercifully precluded retrospective thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the necessity for <i>doing</i> anything was past; there were no
      longer any claims upon her time, nothing to distract her, and she had
      leisure to visualize the full significance of Patrick's death and all that
      it entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather languidly she mounted the stairs to her own room, and drawing up a
      low chair to the fire, sat staring absently into its glowing heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtually, she was alone in the world. Even Major Durward, who had been so
      infinitely kind, was not bound to her by any ties other than those forged
      of his own friendly feelings. True, he had been Patrick's cousin. But
      Patrick, although he had made up Sara's whole world, had been entirely
      unrelated to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart throbbed with a sudden rush of intense gratitude towards the man
      who had so amply fulfilled his trust as guardian, and she glanced up
      wistfully at the big photograph of him which stood upon the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Propped against the photo-frame was a square white envelope on which was
      written: <i>To be given to my ward, Sara Tennant, after my death</i>. The
      family solicitor had handed it to her the previous day, after the reading
      of the will, but the demands upon her time and attention had been so many,
      owing to the number of relatives who temporarily filled the house, that
      she had laid it on one side for perusal when she should be alone once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the familiar handwriting brought a swift mist of tears to her
      eyes, and she hesitated a little before opening the sealed envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange to realize that here was some message for her from Patrick
      himself, but that no matter what the envelope might contain, she would be
      able to give back no answer, make no reply. The knowledge seemed to set
      him very far away from her, and for a few moments she sobbed quietly,
      feeling utterly solitary and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she brushed the tears from her eyes and slit open the flap of
      the envelope. Inside was a half-sheet of notepaper wrapped about a small
      old-fashioned key, and on the outer fold was written: "<i>The key of the
      Chippendale bureau</i>." That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Sara was puzzled. Then she remembered that amongst
      Patrick's personal bequests to her had been that of the small mahogany
      bureau which stood near the window of his bedroom. It had not occurred to
      her at the time that its contents might have any interest for her; in
      fact, she had supposed it to be empty. But now she realized that there was
      evidently something within it which Patrick must have valued, seeing he
      had guarded the key so carefully and directed its delivery to her through
      the reliable hands of his solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather glad of anything that might help to occupy her thoughts, she
      decided to investigate the bureau at once, and accordingly made her way to
      Patrick's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold she paused, her heart contracting painfully as the spick
      and span aspect of the room, its ordered absence of any trace of
      occupation, reminded her that its one-time owner would never again have
      any further need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in the house seemed to present her grief to her anew, from some
      fresh angle, forcing comparison of what had been with what was&mdash;the
      wheeled chair, standing vacant in one of the lobbies, the tobacco jar
      perched upon the chimney-piece, the pot of heliotrope&mdash;Patrick's
      favourite blossom&mdash;scenting the library with its fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now his room&mdash;empty, swept, and garnished like any one of the
      score or so of spare bedrooms in the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort, Sara forced herself to enter it. Crossing to the window,
      she pulled a chair up to the Chippendale bureau and unlocked it. Then she
      drew out the sliding desk supports and laid back the flap of polished
      mahogany that served as a writing-table. She was conscious of a fleeting
      sense of admiration for the fine-grained wood and for the smooth "feel" of
      the old brass handles, worn by long usage, then her whole attention was
      riveted by the three things which were all the contents of the desk&mdash;a
      packet of letters, stained and yellowing with age and tied together with a
      broad, black ribbon, a jeweller's velvet case stamped with faded gilt
      lettering, and an envelope addressed to herself in Patrick's handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very gently, with that tender reverence we accord to the sad little
      possessions of our dead, Sara gathered them up and carried them to her own
      sitting-room. She felt she could not stay to examine them in that
      strangely empty, lifeless room that had been Patrick's; the terrible,
      chill silence of it seemed to beat against the very heart of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying aside the jeweller's case and the package of letters, she opened
      the envelope which bore her name and drew out a folded sheet of paper,
      covered with Patrick's small, characteristic writing. Impulsively she
      brushed it with her lips, then, leaning back in her chair, began to read,
      her expression growing curiously intent as she absorbed the contents of
      the letter. Once she smiled, and more than once a sudden rush of unbidden
      tears blurred the closely written lines in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you receive this, little pal Sara"&mdash;ran the letter&mdash;"I
      shall have done with this world. Except that it means leaving you, my
      dear, I shall be glad to go, for I'm a very tired man. So, when it comes,
      you must try not to grudge me my 'long leave.' But there are several
      things you ought to know, and which I want you to know, yet I have never
      been able to bring myself to speak of them to you. To tell you about them
      meant digging into the past&mdash;and very often there is a hot coal
      lingering in the heart of a dead fire that is apt to burn the fingers of
      whoever rakes out the ashes. Frankly, then, I funked it. But now the time
      has come when I can't put it off any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little old pal, have you ever wondered why I loved you so much&mdash;why
      you stood so close to my heart? I used to tease you and say it was because
      we were no relation to each other, didn't I? If you had been really my
      niece, proper respect (on your part, of course, for your aged uncle!) and
      the barrier of a generation would have set us the usual miles apart. But
      there was never anything of that with us, was there? I bullied you, I
      know, when you needed it, but we were always comrades. And to me, you were
      something more than a comrade, something almost sacred and always adorable&mdash;the
      child of the woman I loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For we should have been married, Sara, your mother and I, had I not been
      a poor man. We were engaged, but at that time, I was only a younger son,
      with a younger son's meager portion, and the prospect of my falling heir
      to Barrow seemed of all things the most improbable. And Pauline
      Malincourt, your mother, had been taught to abhor the idea of living on
      small means&mdash;trained to regard her beauty and breeding as marketable
      assets, to go to the highest bidder. For, although her parents came of
      fine old stock&mdash;there's no better blood in England than the
      Malincourt strain, my dear&mdash;they were deadly hard-up. So hard-up,
      that when they died&mdash;as the result of a carriage accident which
      occurred a week after Pauline's marriage&mdash;they left nothing behind
      them but debts which your father liquidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of your father, Caleb Tennant, the millionaire, I will not write, seeing
      that, after all, you are his child. It is enough to say that he was a hard
      man, and that he and your mother led a very unhappy life together, so
      unhappy that at last she left him, choosing rather to live in utter
      poverty than remain with him. He never forgave her for leaving him, and
      when he died, he willed every penny he possessed to some scoundrelly
      cousin of his&mdash;who is presumably enjoying the inheritance which
      should have been yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your family history, my dear, and it is right that you should
      know it&mdash;and know what you have to fight against. To be a Malincourt
      is at once to have a curse and a blessing hung round your neck. The
      Malincourts were originally of French extraction&mdash;descendants of the
      <i>haute noblesse</i> of old France&mdash;cursed with the devil's own
      pride and passionate self-will, and blessed with looks and brains and
      charm above the average. They never bend; they break sooner. And I think
      you've got the lot, Sara&mdash;the full inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother was a true Malincourt. She could not bend, and when things
      went awry, she broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must never think hardly of her, for she had been brought up in that
      atmosphere of almost desperate pride which is too frequently the curse of
      the poverty-stricken aristocrat. She made a ghastly mistake, and paid for
      it afterwards every day of her life. And she was urged into it by her
      father, who declined to recognize me in any way, and by her mother, who
      made her life at home a simple hell&mdash;as a clever society woman can
      make of any young girl's life if she chooses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just before she died, she sent for me and gave you into my care, begging
      me to shield you from spoiling your life as she had spoiled hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done what I could. You are at least independent. No one can drive
      you with the spur of poverty into selling yourself, as she was driven. But
      there are a hundred other rocks in life against which you may wreck your
      happiness, and remember, in the long run, you sink or swim by your own
      force of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when love comes to you, <i>as it will come</i>,&mdash;for no woman
      with your eyes and your mouth ever yet lived a loveless life!&mdash;never
      forget that it is the biggest thing in the world, the one altogether good
      and perfect gift. Don't let any twopenny-halfpenny considerations of
      worldly advantage influence you, nor the tittle-tattle of other folks, and
      even if it seems that something insurmountable lies between you and the
      fulfillment of love, go over it, or round it, or through it! If it's a
      real love, your faith must be big enough to remove the mountains in the
      way&mdash;or to go over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The package of letters you will find in the bureau were those your mother
      wrote to me during the few short weeks we belonged to each other. I'm a
      sentimental old fool, and I've never been able to bring myself to burn
      them. Will you do this for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the little velvet case you will find her miniature, which I give to
      you. It is very like her&mdash;and like you, too, for you resemble her
      wonderfully in appearance. Often, to look at you has made my heart ache;
      sometimes it almost seemed as if the years had rolled back and Pauline
      herself stood before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now that the order for release is on its way to me, it is rather
      wonderful to reflect that in a few weeks&mdash;a few days, perhaps&mdash;I
      shall be seeing her again. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, little pal of mine. We've had some good times together, haven't
      we?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your devoted, PATRICK."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sat very still, the letter clasped in her hand. She had always
      secretly believed that some long-dead romance lay behind Patrick's
      bachelorhood, but she had never suspected that her own mother had been the
      woman he had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge illumined all the past with a fresh light, investing it with
      a tender, reminiscent sentiment. It was easy now to understand the almost
      idyllic atmosphere Patrick had infused into their life together. Sara
      recognized it as the outcome of a love and fidelity as beautiful and
      devoted as it is rare. Patrick's love for her mother had partaken of the
      enduring qualities of the great passions of history. Paolo and Francesca,
      Abelard and Heloise&mdash;even they could have known no deeper, no more
      lasting love than that of Patrick Lovell for Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love-letters of the dead woman lay on Sara's lap, still tied together
      with the black ribbon which Patrick's fingers must have knotted round
      them. There were only six of them&mdash;half-a-dozen memories of a love
      that had come hopelessly to grief&mdash;tangible memories which her lover
      had never had the heart to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara handled them caressingly, these few, pathetic records of a bygone
      passion, and at length, with hands that shook a little, she removed the
      ribbon that bound them together. Where it had lain, preserving the strip
      of paper beneath it from contact with the dust, bands of white traversed
      the faint discoloration which time had worked upon the outermost envelopes&mdash;mutely
      witnessing to the long years that had passed away since the letters had
      been penned in the first rapturous glow of hot young love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, with a rather wistful sense of regret that it must needs be done,
      Sara dropped them one by one, unread, into the fire, and watched them
      flare up with a sudden spurt of flame, then curl and shrivel into dead,
      grey ash&mdash;those last links with the romance of his youth which
      Patrick had treasured so long and faithfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered what manner of woman her mother could have been to inspire so
      great a love that even her own unfaith had failed to sour it. Her childish
      recollection, blurred by the passage of years, was of a white-faced,
      rather haggard-looking woman with deep-set, haunted eyes and a bitter
      mouth, but whose rare smile, when it came, was so enchanting that it wiped
      out, for the moment, all remembrance of the harsh lines which hardened her
      face when in repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      With eager hands the girl picked up the little velvet case that held the
      miniature, and snapped open the lid. The painting within, rimmed in old
      paste, was of a girl in her early twenties. The face was oval, with a
      small, pointed chin and a vivid red mouth, curling up at the corners.
      There was little colour in the cheeks, and the black hair and
      extraordinarily dark eyes served to enhance the creamy pallor of the skin.
      It was not altogether an English face; the cheek-bones were too high, and
      there was a definiteness of colouring, a decisive sharpness of outline in
      the piquant features, not often found in a purely English type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seen thus, the face looked strangely familiar to Sara, and yet no memory
      of hers could recall her mother as she must have been at the time this
      portrait was painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miniature still in her hand, she moved hesitatingly to a mirror, so
      placed that the light from the window fell full upon her as she faced it.
      In a moment the odd sense of familiarity was explained. There, looking
      back at her from the mirror, was the same sharply angled face, the same
      warm ivory pallor of complexion, accentuated by raven hair and black,
      sombre eyes. What was it Patrick had written? "<i>No woman with your eyes
      and your mouth ever yet lived a loveless life.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a curious deliberation, Sara examined the features in question. The
      eyes were long, and the lids, opaquely white and fringed with jet-black
      lashes, slanted downwards a little at the outer corners, bestowing a
      curiously intense expression, such as one sometimes sees in the eyes of an
      actor, and the mouth was the same vividly scarlet mouth of the face in the
      miniature, at once passionate and sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French strain in the Malincourt family had reproduced itself
      indubitably, both in the appearance of Pauline and of Pauline's daughter.
      Would the mother's tragedy, fruit of her singular charm and of a pride
      which had accorded love but a secondary place in her scheme of life, also
      be re-enacted in the case of the daughter? It seemed almost as though
      Patrick must have had pre-vision of some like fiery ordeal though which
      his "little old pal" might have to pass, so urgent had been the warning he
      had uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shivered, as if she, too, felt a prescience of coming disaster. It
      was as though a shadow had fallen across her path, a shadow of which the
      substance lay hidden, shrouded in the mists which veil the future.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ELISABETH&mdash;AND HER SON
    </h3>
    <p>
      The entrance to Barrow Court was somewhat forbidding. A flight of shallow
      granite steps, flanked by balustrades of the same austere substance,
      terminating in huge, rough-hewn pillars, led up to an enormous door of
      ancient oak, studded with nails&mdash;destined, it would seem, to resist
      the onslaught of an armed multitude. The sternness of its aspect, when the
      great door was closed, seemed to add an increased warmth to the suggestion
      of welcome it conveyed when, as now, it was swung hospitably open,
      emitting a ruddy glow of firelight from the hall beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was standing at the top of the granite steps, waiting to greet the
      Durwards, whose approach was already heralded by the humming of a motor
      far down the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint regret disquieted her. This was the last&mdash;the very last&mdash;time
      she would stand at the head of those stairs in the capacity of a hostess
      welcoming her guests; and even now her position there was merely an
      honorary one! In a few minutes, when Mrs. Durward should step across the
      threshold, it was she who would be transformed into the hostess, while
      Sara would have to take her place as a simple guest in the house which for
      twelve years had been her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrusting the thought determinedly aside, she watched the big limousine
      swing smoothly round the curve of the drive and pull up in front of the
      house, and there was no trace of reluctance in the smile of greeting which
      she summoned up for Major Durward's benefit as he alighted and came
      towards her with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where are the others?" asked Sara, seeing that the chauffeur
      immediately headed the car for the garage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're coming along on foot," explained Durward. "Elisabeth declared
      they should see nothing of the place cooped up in the car, so they got out
      at the lodge and are walking across the park."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara preceded him into the hall, and they stood chatting together by the
      tea-table until the sound of voices announced the arrival of the rest of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are!" exclaimed Durward, hurrying forward to meet them, while
      Sara followed a trifle hesitatingly, conscious of a sudden accession of
      shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the charming letter she had received from Mrs. Durward,
      begging her to remain at Barrow Court exactly as long as it suited her,
      now that the moment had come which would actually install the new mistress
      of the Court, she began to feel as though her continued presence there
      might be regarded rather in the light of an intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Durward's letter might very well have been dictated only by a certain
      superficial politeness, or, even, solely at the instance of her husband,
      and it was conceivable that the writer would be none too pleased that her
      invitation had been so literally interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a few seconds of time Sara contrived to work herself up
      into a condition bordering upon panic. And then a very low contralto
      voice, indescribably sweet, and with an audacious ripple of laughter
      running through it, swept all her scruples into the rubbish heap. There
      was no doubting the sincerity of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was so nice of you not to run away, Miss Tennant." As she spoke, Mrs.
      Durward shook hands cordially. "Poor Geoffrey couldn't help being the
      heir, you know, and if you'd refused to stay, he'd have felt just like the
      villain in a cinema film. You've saved us from becoming the crawling,
      self-reproachful wretches." Then she turned and beckoned to her son. "This
      is Tim," she said simply, but the quality of her voice was very much as
      though she had announced: "This is the sun, and moon, and stars."
    </p>
    <p>
      As mother and son stood side by side, Sara's first impression was that she
      had never seen two more beautiful people. They were both tall, and a kind
      of radiance seemed to envelope them&mdash;a glory imparted by the sheer
      force of perfect symmetry and health&mdash;and, in the case of the former
      of the two, there was an added charm in a certain little air of
      stateliness and distinction which characterized her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick's reminiscent comment on Elisabeth Durward recalled itself to
      Sara's mind: "I think she was one of the most beautiful women I have ever
      seen," and she recognized that almost any one might have truthfully
      subscribed to the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Durward must have been at least forty years of age&mdash;arguing from
      the presence of the six foot of young manhood whom she called son&mdash;but
      her appearance was still that of a woman who had not long passed her
      thirtieth milestone. The supple lines of her figure held the merest
      suggestion of maturity in their gracious curves, and the rich chestnut
      hair, swathed round her small, fine head, gleamed with the sheen which
      only youth or immense vitality bestows. Her skin was of that almost
      dazzling purity which is so often found in conjunction with reddish hair,
      and the defect of over-light brows and lashes, which not infrequently mars
      the type, was conspicuously absent. Her eyes were arresting. They were of
      a deep, hyacinth blue, very luminous and soft, and quite beautiful. But
      they held a curiously veiled expression&mdash;a something guarded and
      inscrutable&mdash;as though they hid some secret inner knowledge
      sentinelled from the world at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, meeting their still, enigmatic gaze, was subtly conscious of an odd
      sense of repulsion, almost amounting to dread, and then Elisabeth, making
      some trivial observation as she moved nearer to the fire, smiled across at
      her, and, in the extraordinary charm of her smile, the momentary sensation
      of fear was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it was with a feeling of relief that Sara encountered the
      gay, frank glance of the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim Durward, though dowered to the full with his mother's beauty, had yet
      been effectually preserved from the misfortune of being an effeminate
      repetition of her. In him, Elisabeth's glowing auburn colouring had
      sobered to a steady brown&mdash;evidenced in the crisp, curly hair and
      sun-tanned skin; and the misty hyacinth-blue of her eyes had hardened in
      the eyes of her son into the clear, bright azure of the sea, whist the
      beautiful contours of her face, repeated in his, had strengthened into a
      fine young virility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't cure mother of introducing me as if I were the Lord Mayor," he
      murmured plaintively to Sara as they sat down to tea. "I suppose it's the
      penalty of being an only son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort," asserted Elisabeth composedly. "Naturally I'm
      pleased with you&mdash;you're so absurdly like me. I always look upon you
      in the light of a perpetual compliment, because you've elected to grow up
      like me instead of like Geoffrey"&mdash;nodding towards her husband.
      "After all, you had us both to choose from."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim shouted with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to her, Miss Tennant! And for years I've been mistaking mere
      vulgar female vanity for maternal solicitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, you're a very poor compliment," threw in Major Durward, with an
      expressive glance at his wife's beautiful face. It was obvious that he
      worshipped her, and she smiled across at him, blushing adorably, just like
      a girl of sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim turned to Sara with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great trial, Miss Tennant, to be blessed with two parents&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite usual," interpolated Geoffrey mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two parents," continued Tim, firmly ignoring him, "who are hopelessly,
      besottedly in love with each other. Instead of being&mdash;as I ought to
      be&mdash;the apple of their eye&mdash;of both their eyes&mdash;I'm merely
      the shadowy third."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara surveyed his goodly proportions consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one would have suspected it," she assured him; and Tim grinned
      appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you stay with us long," he replied, "as I hope"&mdash;impressively&mdash;"you
      will, you'll soon perceive how utterly I am neglected. Perhaps"&mdash;his
      face brightening&mdash;"you may be moved to take pity on my solitude&mdash;quite
      frequently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim, stop being an idiot," interposed his mother placidly, holding out
      her cup, "and ask Miss Tennant to give me another lump of sugar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The advent of the Durwards, breaking in upon her enforced solitude, helped
      very considerably to arouse Sara from the natural depression into which
      she had fallen after Patrick's death. With their absurdly large share of
      good looks, their charmingly obvious attachment to each other, and their
      enthusiastic, unconventional hospitality towards such an utter stranger as
      herself, devoid of any real claim upon them, she found the trio
      unexpectedly interesting and delightful. They had hailed her as a friend,
      and her frank, warm-hearted nature responded instantly, speedily according
      each of them a special niche in her regard. She felt as though Providence
      had suddenly endowed her with a whole family&mdash;"all complete and ready
      for use," as Tim cheerfully observed&mdash;and the reaction from the
      oppressive consciousness of being entirely alone in the world acted like a
      tonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first brief sentiment of aversion which she had experienced towards
      Elisabeth melted like snow in sunshine under the daily charm of her
      companionship; and though the hyacinth eyes held always in their depths
      that strange suggestion of mystery, Sara grew to believe it must be merely
      some curious effect incidental to the colour and shape of the eyes
      themselves, rather than an indication of the soul that looked out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something perennially captivating about Elisabeth. An atmosphere
      of romance enveloped her, engendering continuous interest and surmise, and
      Sara found it wholly impossible to view her from an ordinary prosaic
      standpoint. Occasionally she would recall the fact that Mrs. Durward was
      in reality a woman of over forty, mother of a grown-up son who, according
      to all the usages of custom, should be settling down into the drab and
      placid backwater of middle age, but she realized that the description went
      ludicrously wide of the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in the least drab about Elisabeth, nor would there ever
      be. She was full of colour and brilliance, reminding one of a great
      glowing-hearted rose in its prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of her charm, undoubtedly, lay in her attitude towards husband and
      son. She was still as romantically in love with Major Durward as any girl
      in her teens, and she adored Tim quite openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably, perhaps, there was a touch of the spoilt woman about her,
      since both men combined to indulge her in every whim. Nevertheless, there
      was nothing either small or petty in her willfulness. It was rather the
      superb, stately arrogance of a queen, and she was kindness itself to Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the largest share of credit in restoring the latter to a more normal
      and less highly strung condition was due to Tim, who gravitated towards
      her with the facility common to natural man when he finds himself for any
      length of time under the same roof with an attractive young person of the
      opposite sex. He had an engaging habit of appearing at the door of Sara's
      sitting-room with an ingratiating: "I say, may I come in for a yarn?" And,
      upon receiving permission, he would establish himself on the hearth-rug at
      her feet and proceed to prattle to her about his own affairs, much as a
      brother might have done to a favourite sister, and with an equal assurance
      that his confidences would be met with sympathetic interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do with yourself, Tim?" asked Sara one day, as he
      sprawled in blissful indolence on the great bearskin in front of her fire,
      pulling happily at a beloved old pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do with myself?" he repeated. "What do you mean? I'm doing very
      comfortably just at present"&mdash;glancing round him appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;what are you going to be? Aren't you going to enter any
      profession?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim sat up suddenly, removing his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not? You can't slack about here for ever, doing nothing. I should
      have thought you would have gone into the Army, like your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I wanted to do," he said gruffly. "But the mother wouldn't
      hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could sense the pain in his suddenly roughened tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why? You'd make a splendid soldier, Tim"&mdash;eyeing his long length
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have loved it," he said wistfully. "I wanted it more than
      anything. But mother worried so frightfully whenever I suggested the idea
      that I had to give it up. I'm to learn to be a landowner and squire and
      all that sort of tosh instead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that could come later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it could. But mother refused point-blank to let me go to
      Sandhurst. So now, unless a war crops up&mdash;and it doesn't look as
      though there's much chance of that!&mdash;I'm out of the running. But if
      it ever does, Sara"&mdash;he laid his hand eagerly on her knee&mdash;"I
      swear I'll be one of the first to volunteer. I was a fool to give in to
      the mother over the matter, only she was simply making herself ill about
      it, and, of course, I couldn't stand that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara wondered why Mrs. Durward should have interfered to prevent her son
      from following what was obviously his natural bent. It would have seemed
      almost inevitable that, as a soldier's son, he should enter one or other
      of the Services, and instead, here he was, stranded in a little country
      backwater, simply eating his heart out. Mentally she determined to broach
      the subject to Elisabeth as soon as an opportunity presented itself; but
      for the moment she skillfully drew the conversation away from what was
      evidently a sore subject, and suggested that Tim should accompany her into
      Fallowdene, where she had an errand at the post office. He assented
      eagerly, with a shake of his broad shoulders as though to rid himself of
      the disagreeable burden of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window of his wife's sitting-room Major Durward watched the two
      as they started on their way to the village, evidently on the best of
      terms with one another, a placid smile spreading beneficently over his
      face as they vanished round the corner of the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything in it, do you think?" he asked, seeing that Elisabeth's gaze had
      pursued the same course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's impossible to say," she answered quietly. "Tim imagines himself to
      be falling in love, I don't doubt; but at twenty-two a boy imagines
      himself in love with half the girls he meets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't," declared Geoffrey promptly. "I fell in love with you at the
      mature age of nineteen&mdash;and I never fell out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth flashed him a charming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Tim may follow in your footsteps, then," she suggested serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, would you be pleased?" persisted her husband, jerking his head
      explanatorily in the direction in which Sara and Tim had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall always be pleased with the woman who makes Tim happy," she
      answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durward was silent a moment; then he returned to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a very pretty young woman, don't you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara? No, I shouldn't call her exactly pretty. Her face is too thin, and
      strong, and eager. But she is a very uncommon type&mdash;like a black and
      white etching, and immensely attractive."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several days before Sara was able to introduce the topic of Tim's
      profession, but she contrived it one afternoon when she and Elisabeth were
      sitting together awaiting the return of the two men for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be profession enough for Tim to look after the property,"
      Elisabeth made answer. "He can act as agent for his father to some extent,
      and relieve him of a great deal of necessary business that has to be
      transacted."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a certain finality which made it difficult to pursue the
      subject, but Sara, remembering Tim's suddenly hard young eyes, persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a pity he cannot go into the Army&mdash;he's so keen on it," she
      suggested tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious change came over Elisabeth's face. It seemed to Sara as though a
      veil had descended, from behind which the inscrutable eyes were watching
      her warily. But the response was given lightly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, one of the family in the Service is enough. I should see so little of
      my Tim if he became a soldier&mdash;only an occasional 'leave.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would make a very good soldier," said Sara. "To my mind, it's the
      finest profession in the world for any man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" Elisabeth spoke coldly. "There are many risks attached
      to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara experienced a revulsion of feeling; she had not expected Elisabeth to
      be of the fearful type of woman. Women of splendid physique and abounding
      vitality are rarely obsessed by craven apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think the risks would count with Tim," she said warmly. "He has
      any amount of pluck." And then she stared at Elisabeth in amazement. A
      sudden haggardness had overspread the elder woman's face, the faint
      shell-pink that usually flushed her cheeks draining away and leaving them
      milk-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied in stifled tones. "I don't suppose Tim's a coward. But"&mdash;more
      lightly&mdash;"I think I am. I&mdash;don't think I care for the Army as a
      profession. Tim is my only child," she added self-excusingly. "I can't let
      him run risks&mdash;of any kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, an odd foreboding seized hold of Sara. It was as though the
      secret dread of <i>something</i>&mdash;she could not tell what&mdash;which
      held the mother had communicated itself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered. Then, the impression fading as quickly as it had come, she
      spoke defiantly, as if trying to reassure herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There aren't many risks in these piping times of peace. Soldiers don't
      die in battle nowadays; they retire on a pension."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Die in battle! Did you think I was afraid of that?" There was a sudden
      fierce contempt in Elisabeth's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked at her with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weren't you?" she said hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth seemed about to make some passionate rejoinder. Then, all at
      once, she checked herself, and again Sara was conscious of that curiously
      secretive expression in her eyes, as though she were on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are many things worse than death," she said evasively, and
      deliberately turned the conversation into other channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days that followed, Sara became aware of a faintly perceptible
      difference in her relations with Elisabeth. The latter was still just as
      charming as ever, but she seemed, in some inexplicable way, to have set a
      limit to their intimacy&mdash;defined a boundary line which she never
      intended to be overstepped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though she felt that she had allowed Sara to approach too nearly
      some inner sanctum which she had hitherto guarded securely from all
      intrusion, and now hastened to erect a barricade against a repetition of
      the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once, lately, Sara had broached the subject of her impending
      departure from Barrow, only to have the suggestion incontinently brushed
      aside by Major Durward, who declared that he declined to discuss any such
      disagreeable topic. But now, sensitively conscious that she had troubled
      Elisabeth's peace in some way, she decided to make definite arrangements
      regarding her immediate future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was agreeably surprised, when she propounded her idea, to find Mrs.
      Durward seemed quite as unwilling to part with her as were both her
      husband and son. Apparently the alteration in her manner, with its
      curiously augmented reticence, was no indication of any personal
      antipathy, and Sara felt proportionately relieved, although somewhat
      mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall all miss you," averred Elisabeth, and there was absolute
      sincerity in her tones. "I don't see why you need be in such a hurry to
      run away from us." And Geoffrey and Tim chorused approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara beamed upon them all with humid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's dear of you to want me to stay with you," she declared. "But, don't
      you see, I <i>must</i> live my own life&mdash;have a roof-tree of my own?
      I can't just sit down comfortably in the shade of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pushful young woman!" chaffed Geoffrey. "Well, I can see your mind is
      made up. So what are your plans? Let's hear them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of taking rooms for a while with some really nice people&mdash;gentlefolk
      who wanted to take a paying guest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor but honest, in fact," supplemented Geoffrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You see"&mdash;smiling&mdash;"you people have spoiled me for living
      alone, and as I'm really rather a solitary individual, I must find a
      little niche for myself somewhere." She unfolded a letter she was holding.
      "I thought I should like to go near the sea&mdash;to some quite tiny
      country place at the back of beyond. And I think I've found just the
      thing. I saw an advertisement for a paying guest&mdash;of the female
      persuasion&mdash;so I replied to it, and I've just had an answer to my
      letter. It's from a doctor man&mdash;a Dr. Selwyn, at Monkshaven&mdash;who
      has an invalid wife and one daughter, and he writes such an original kind
      of epistle that I'm sure I should like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Geoffrey held out his hand for the letter, running his eyes down its
      contents, while his wife, receiving an assenting nod from Sara in response
      to her "May I?" looked over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Tim appeared to take no interest in the matter, but remained standing
      rather aloof, staring out of the window, his back to the trio grouped
      around the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Household . . . myself, wife, one daughter,'" muttered Geoffrey. "Um-um&mdash;'quarter
      of a mile from the sea'&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;'As you will have guessed
      from the fact of my advertising'"&mdash;here he began to read aloud&mdash;"'we
      are not too lavishly blessed with this world's goods. Our house is roomy
      and comfortable, though abominably furnished. But I can guarantee the
      climate, and there are plenty of nicer people than ourselves in the
      neighbourhood. It wouldn't be fitting for me to blow our own particular
      household trumpet&mdash;nor, to tell the truth, is it always calculated to
      give forth melodious sounds; but if the other considerations I have
      mentioned commend themselves to you, I suggest that you come down and make
      trial of us.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think he sounds just delightful?" queried Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manlike, Geoffrey shook his head disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," he said decisively. "That's the most unbusinesslike letter
      I've ever read."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> like it very much," announced Elisabeth with equal decision.
      "The man writes just as he thinks&mdash;perfectly frankly and naturally. I
      should go and give them a trial as he suggests. Sara, if I were you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I feel inclined to do," replied Sara. "I thought it a
      delicious letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Geoffrey shrugged his shoulders resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, of course, if you two women have made up your minds that the man's
      a natural saint, I may as well hold my peace. What's the fellow's address?&mdash;I'll
      look him up in the Medical Directory. Richard Selwyn, Sunnyside,
      Monkshaven&mdash;that right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed to the library in search of Dr. Selywn's credentials,
      presently returning with a somewhat rueful grin on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems all right&mdash;rather a clever man, judging by his degrees and
      the appointments he has held," he acknowledged grudgingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure he's all right, asserted Sara firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although I don't understand why such a good man at his job should be
      practicing in a little one-horse place like Monkshaven," retorted Geoffrey
      maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably he went there on account of his wife's health," suggested
      Elisabeth. "He says she is an invalid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well"&mdash;Geoffrey yielded unwillingly&mdash;"I suppose you'll go,
      Sara. But if the experiment isn't a success you must come back to us at
      once. Is that a bargain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Promise," commanded Geoffrey. "Or"&mdash;firmly&mdash;"I'm hanged if we
      let you go at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," agreed Sara meekly. "I'll promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope the experiment will be an utter failure," observed Tim, later on,
      when he and Sara were alone together. He spoke with an oddly curt&mdash;almost
      inimical&mdash;inflection in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that's unkind of you, Tim," she protested smilingly. "I thought you
      were a good enough pal not to want to chortle over me&mdash;as I know
      Geoffrey will&mdash;should the thing turn out a frost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm not, then," he returned roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churlish tones were so unlike Tim that Sara looked up at him in some
      amazement. He was staring down at her with a strange, <i>awakened</i>
      expression in his eyes; his face was very white and his mouth working.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden apprehension of what was impending, she sprang up,
      stretching out her hand as though to ward it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no, Tim. It isn't&mdash;don't say it's that&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand and held it between both his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it <i>is</i> that," he said, speaking very fast, the serenity of his
      face all broken up by the surge of emotion that had gripped him. "It is
      that. I love you. I didn't know it till you spoke of going away. Sara&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" She broke in hastily. "Don't say any more, Tim&mdash;please
      don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed the two young faces peered at each other&mdash;the
      one desperate with love, the other full of infinite regret and pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use, then?" said Tim dully. "You don't care?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I don't&mdash;not like that. I thought we were friends&mdash;just
      friends, Tim," she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim lifted his head, and she saw that somehow, in the last few minutes, he
      had grown suddenly older. His gay, smiling mouth had set itself sternly;
      the beautiful boyish face had become a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so, too," he said gently. "But I know now that what I feel for
      you isn't friendship. It's"&mdash;with a short, grim laugh&mdash;"something
      much more than that. Tell me, Sara&mdash;will there ever be any chance for
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. She was so genuinely fond of him that she hated to give him
      pain. Looking at him, standing before her in his splendid young manhood,
      she wondered irritably why she <i>didn't</i> love him. He was
      pre-eminently loveable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught eagerly at her hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't answer me now!" he said swiftly. "I'll wait&mdash;give me a chance.
      I can't take no . . . I won't take it!" he went on masterfully. "I love
      you!" Impetuously he slipped his strong young arms about her and kissed
      her on the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous moment she had been all softness and regret, but now, at the
      sudden passion in his voice, something within her recoiled violently,
      repudiating the claim his love had made upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was the last woman in the world to be taken by storm. She was too
      individual, her sense of personal independence too strongly developed, for
      her ever to be swept off her feet by a passion to which her own heart
      offered no response. Instead, it roused her to a definite consciousness of
      opposition, and she drew herself away from Tim's eager arms with a
      decision there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Tim," she said quietly. "But it's no good pretending I'm in
      love with you. I'm not."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with moody, dissatisfied eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've spoken too soon," he said. "I should have waited. Only I was
      afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." He spoke uncertainly. "I've had a feeling that if I let you go,
      you'll meet some man down there, at Monkshaven, who'll want to marry you .
      . . And I shall lose you! . . . Oh, Sara! I don't ask you to say you love
      me&mdash;yet. Say that you'll marry me . . . I'd teach you the rest&mdash;you'd
      learn to love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But that fierce, unpremeditated kiss&mdash;the first lover's kiss that she
      had known&mdash;had endowed her with a sudden clarity of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered steadily. "I don't know much about love, Tim, but I'm
      very sure it's no use trying to manufacture it to order, and&mdash;listen,
      Tim, dear," the pain in his face making her suddenly all tenderness again&mdash;"if
      I married you, and afterwards you <i>couldn't</i> teach me as you think
      you could, we should only be wretched together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could never be wretched if you were my wife," he answered doggedly.
      "I've love enough for two."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Tim. Don't let's spoil a good friendship by turning it into a
      one-sided love-affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled rather grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it's too late to prevent that," he said drily. "But I won't
      worry you any more now, dear. Only&mdash;I'm not going to accept your
      answer as final."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would," she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her curiously. "No man who loves you, Sara, is going to give
      you up very easily," he averred. Then, after a moment: "you'll let me
      write to you sometimes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;but not love-letters, Tim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not love-letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her hands and kissed first one and then the other. Then, with
      his head well up and his shoulders squared, he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sea-blue eyes that had been wont to look out on the world so gaily
      had suddenly lost their care-free bravery. They were the eyes of a man who
      has looked for the first time into the radiant, sorrowful face of Love,
      and read therein all the possibilities&mdash;the glory and the pain and
      the supreme happiness&mdash;which Love holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sara, standing alone and regretful that the friend had been lost in
      the lover, never guessed that Tim's love was a thread which was destined
      to cross and re-cross those other threads held by the fingers of Fate
      until it had tangled the whole fabric of her life.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAN IN THE TRAIN
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Oldhampton! Oldhampton! Change here for Motchley and Monkshaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a sigh of relief that Sara, in obedience to the warning
      raucously intoned by a hurrying porter, vacated her seat in the railway
      compartment in which she had travelled from Fallowdene. Her companions on
      the journey had been an elderly spinster and her maid, and as the former
      had insisted upon the exclusion of every breath of outside air, Sara felt
      half-suffocated by the time they ran into Oldhampton Junction. The
      Monkshaven train was already standing in the station, and, commissioning a
      porter to transfer her luggage, she sauntered leisurely along the
      platform, searching vainly for an empty compartment, where the regulation
      of the supply of oxygen would not depend upon the caprice of an old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train appeared to be very full, but at last she espied a first-class
      smoking carriage which boasted but a single occupant&mdash;a man in the
      far corner, half-hidden behind the newspaper he was holding&mdash;and,
      tipping her porter, she stepped into the compartment and busied herself
      bestowing her hand-baggage in the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the corner abruptly lowered his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This be a smoker," he remarked significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara turned at the sound of his voice. The unwelcoming tones made it
      abundantly clear that the remainder of his thought ran: "And you've no
      business to get into it." A spark of amusement lit itself in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The railway company indicate as much on the window," she replied
      placidly, with a glance towards the <i>Smoking Carriage</i> label pasted
      against the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no response, unless an irritated crackling of newspaper could
      be regarded as such&mdash;and the next moment, to the accompaniment of
      much banging of doors and a final shout of: "Stand away there!" the train
      began to move slowly out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sat down with a sigh of relief that she had escaped her former
      travelling companions, with their unpleasant predilection for a vitiated
      atmosphere, and her thoughts wandered idly to the consideration of the man
      in the corner, to whom she was obviously an equally unwelcome
      fellow-passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had retired once more behind his newspaper, and practically all that
      was offered for her contemplation consisted of a pair of knee-breeches and
      well-cut leather leggings and two strong-looking, sun-tanned hands. These
      latter intrigued Sara considerably&mdash;their long, sensitive fingers and
      short, well-kept nails according curiously with their sunburnt suggestion
      of great physical strength and an outdoor life. She wished their owner
      would see fit to lower his newspaper once more, since her momentary
      glimpse of his face had supplied her with but little idea of his
      personality. And the hands, so full of contradictory suggestion, aroused
      her interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though in response to her thoughts, the newspaper suddenly crackled
      down on to its owner's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have every intention of smoking," he announced aggressively. "This is a
      smoking carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, supported by the recollection of a dainty little gold and enamel
      affair in her hand-bag, filled with some very special Russian cigarettes,
      smiled amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it is," she replied in unruffled tones. "That's why I got in. I,
      too, have every intention of smoking."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in silence for a moment, then, without further comment,
      produced a pipe and tobacco pouch from the depths of a pocket, and
      proceeded to fill the former, carefully pressing down the tobacco with the
      tip of one of those slender, capable-looking fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara observed him quickly. As he lounged there indolently in his corner,
      she was aware of a subtle combination of strength and fine tempering in
      the long, supple lines of his limbs&mdash;something that suggested the
      quality of steel, hard, yet pliant. He had a lean, hard-bitten face,
      tanned by exposure to the sun and wind, and the clean-shaven lips met with
      a curious suggestion of bitter reticence in their firm closing. His hair
      was brown&mdash;"plain brown" as Sara mentally characterized it&mdash;but
      it had a redeeming kink in it and the crispness of splendid vitality. The
      eyes beneath the straight, rather frowning brows were hazel, and, even in
      the brief space of time occupied by the inimical colloquy of a few moments
      ago, Sara had been struck by the peculiar intensity of their regard&mdash;an
      odd depth and brilliance only occasionally to be met with, and then
      preferably in those eyes which are a somewhat light grey in colour and
      ringed round the outer edge of the iris with a deeper tint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flare of a match roused her from her half-idle, half-interested
      contemplation of her fellow-passenger, and, as he lit his pipe, she was
      sharply conscious that his oddly luminous eyes were regarding her with a
      glint of irony in their depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly she recalled his hostile reception of her entrance into the
      compartment, and the defiantly given explanation she had tendered in
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very deliberately she extracted her cigarette-case from her bag and
      selected a cigarette, only to discover that she had not supplied herself
      with a matchbox. She hunted assiduously amongst the assortment of odds and
      ends the bag contained, but in vain, and finally, a little nettled that
      her companion made no attempt to supply the obvious deficiency, she looked
      up to find that he was once more, to all appearances, completely absorbed
      in his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara regarded him with indignation; in her own mind she was perfectly
      convinced that he was aware of her quandary and had no mind to help her
      out of it. Evidently he had not forgiven her intrusion into his solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boor!" she ejaculated mentally. Then, aloud, and with considerable
      acerbity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you oblige me with a match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With no show of alacrity, and with complete indifference of manner, he
      produced a matchbox and handed it to her, immediately reverting to his
      newspaper as though considerably bored by the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara flushed, and, having lit her cigarette, tendered him his matchbox
      with an icy little word of thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, however, he was quite unashamed of his churlishness, for he
      accepted the box without troubling to raise his eyes from the page he was
      reading, and the remainder of the journey to Monkshaven was accomplished
      in an atmosphere that bristled with hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train slowed up into the station, it became evident to Sara that
      Monkshaven was also the destination of her travelling companion, for he
      proceeded with great deliberation to fold up his newspaper and to hoist
      his suit-case down from the rack. It did not seem to occur to him to
      proffer his service to Sara, who was struggling with her own hand-luggage,
      and the instant the train came to a standstill he opened the door of the
      compartment, stopped out on to the platform, and marched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of amusement crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder who he is?" she reflected, as she followed in the wake of a
      porter in search of her trunks. "He certainly needs a lesson in manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      Within herself she registered a vindictive vow that, should the
      circumstances of her residence in Monkshaven afford the opportunity, she
      would endeavour to give him one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monkshaven was but a tiny little station, and it was soon apparent that no
      conveyance of any kind had been sent to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, there would be none," opined the porter of whom she inquired. "Dr.
      Selwyn keeps naught but a little pony-trap, and he's most times using it
      himself. But there's a 'bus from the Cliff Hotel meets all trains, miss,
      and"&mdash;with pride&mdash;"there's a station keb."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Sara was the proud&mdash;and thankful&mdash;occupant of
      the "station keb," and, after bumping over the cobbles with which the
      station yard was paved, she found herself being driven in leisurely
      fashion through the high street of the little town, whilst her driver,
      sitting sideways on his box, indicated the points of interest with his
      whip as they went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the cab turned out of the town and began the ascent of a steep
      hill, and as they climbed the winding road, Sara found that she could
      glimpse the sea, rippling greyly beyond the town, and tufted with little
      bunches of spume whipped into being by the keen March wind. The town
      itself spread out before her, an assemblage of red and grey tiled roofs
      sloping downwards to the curve of the bay, while, on the right, a bold
      promontory thrust itself into the sea, grimly resisting the perpetual
      onslaught of the wave. Through the waning light of the winter's afternoon,
      Sara could discern the outline of a house limned against the dark
      background of woods that crowned it. Linked to the jutting headland, a
      long range of sea-washed cliffs stretched as far as the eyes could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That be Monk's Cliff," vouchsafed the driver conversationally. "Bit of a
      lonesome place for folks to choose to live at, ain't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who lives there?" asked Sara with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentleman of the name of Trent&mdash;queer kind of bloke he must be, too,
      if all's true they say of 'im. He's lived there a matter of ten years or
      more&mdash;lives by 'imself with just a man and his wife to do for 'im.
      Far End, they calls the 'ouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far End," repeated Sara. The name conveyed an odd sense of remoteness and
      inaccessibility. It seemed peculiarly appropriate to a house built thus on
      the very edge of the mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested musingly on the bleak promontory. It would be a fit abode,
      she thought, for some recluse, determined to eschew the society of his
      fellow-men; here he could dwell, solitary and apart, surrounded on three
      sides by the grey, dividing sea, and protected on the fourth by the steep
      untempting climb that lay betwixt the town and the lonely house on the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ere you are, miss. This is Dr. Selwyn's."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of her Jehu roused her from her reflections to find that the cab
      had stopped in front of a white-painted wooden gate bearing the legend,
      "Sunnyside," painted in black letters across its topmost bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take the keb round to the stable-yard, miss; it'll be more
      convenient-like for the luggage," added the man, with a mildly
      disapproving glance towards the narrow tiled path leading from the gate to
      the house-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded, and, having paid him his fare, made her way through the white
      gateway and along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed a curious absence of life about the place. No sound of voices
      broke the silence, and, although the front door stood invitingly open,
      there was no sign of any one hovering in the background ready to receive
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely chilled&mdash;since, of course, they must be expecting her&mdash;she
      rang the bell. It clanged noisily through the house but failed to produce
      any more important result than the dislodging of some dust from a ledge
      above which the bell-wire ran. Sara watched it fall and lie on the floor
      in a little patch of fine, greyish powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall, of which the open door gave view, though of considerable
      dimensions, was poorly furnished. The wide expanse of colour-washed wall
      was broken only by a hat-stand, on which hung a large assortment of
      masculine hats and coats, all of them looking considerably the worse for
      wear, and by two straight-backed chairs placed with praiseworthy
      exactitude at equal distances apart from the aforesaid rather overburdened
      piece of furniture. The floor was covered with linoleum of which the black
      and white chess-board pattern had long since retrogressed with usage into
      an uninspiring blur. A couple of threadbare rugs completed a somewhat
      depressing "interior."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara rang the bell a second time, on this occasion with an irritable force
      that produced clangour enough, one would have thought, to awaken the dead.
      It served, at all events, to arouse the living, for presently heavy
      footsteps could be heard descending the stairs, and, finally, a
      middle-aged maidservant, whose cap had obviously been assumed in haste,
      appeared, confronting Sara with an air of suspicion that seemed rather to
      suggest that she might have come after the spoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor's out," she announced somewhat truculently. Then, before Sara
      had time to formulate any reply, she added, a thought more graciously:
      "Maybe you're a stranger to these parts. Surgery hour's not till six
      o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently fully prepared for Sara to accept this as a dismissal,
      and looked considerably astonished when the latter queried meekly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then can I see Miss Selwyn, please? I understand Mrs. Selwyn is an
      invalid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right there. The mistress isn't up for seeing visitors. And Miss
      Molly, she's not home&mdash;she's away to Oldhampton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" stammered Sara. "They're expecting me,
      surely? I'm Miss Tennant," she added by way of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Tennant! Sakes alive!" The woman threw up her hands, staring at Sara
      with an almost comic expression, halting midway between bewilderment and
      horror. "If that isn't just the way of them," she went on indignantly,
      "never mentioning that 'twas to-day you were coming&mdash;and no sheets
      aired to your bed and all! The master, he never so much as named it to me,
      nor Miss Molly neither. But please to come in, miss&mdash;" her outraged
      sense of hospitality infusing a certain limited cordiality into her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman led the way into a sitting-room that opened off the hall,
      standing aside for Sara to pass in, then, muttering half-inaudibly,
      "You'll be liking a cup of tea, I expect," she disappeared into the back
      regions of the house, whence a distant clattering of china shortly gave
      indication that the proffered refreshment was in course of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara seated herself in a somewhat battered armchair and proceeded to take
      stock of the room in which she found herself. It tallied accurately with
      what the hall had led her to expect. Most of the furniture had been good
      of its kind at one time, but it was now all reduced to a drab level of
      shabbiness. There were a few genuine antiques amongst it&mdash;a couple of
      camel-backed Chippendale chairs, a grandfather's clock, and some fine old
      bits of silver&mdash;which Sara's eye, accustomed to the rare and
      beautiful furnishings of Barrow Court, singled out at once from the olla
      podrida of incongruous modern stuff. These alone had survived the general
      condition of disrepair; but, even so, the silver had a neglected
      appearance and stood badly in need of cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter criticism might have been leveled with equal justice at almost
      everything in the room, and Sara, mindful of her reception, reflected that
      in such an oddly conducted household, where the advent of an expected, and
      obviously much-needed, paying guest could be completely overlooked, it was
      hardly probable that smaller details of house-management would receive
      their meed of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of depressing her, however, the forlorn aspect of the room
      assisted to raise her spirits. It looked as though there might very well
      be a niche in such a household that she could fill. Mentally she proceeded
      to make a tour of the room, duster in hand, and she had just reached the
      point where, in imagination, she was about to place a great bowl of
      flowers in the middle desert of the table, when the elderly Abigail
      re-appeared and dumped a tea-tray down in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara made a wry face over the tea. It tasted flat, and she could well
      imagine the long-boiling kettle from which the water with which it had
      been made was poured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure that tea's beastly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A masculine voice sounded abruptly from the doorway, and, looking up, Sara
      beheld a tall, eager-faced man, wearing a loose shabby coat and carrying
      in one hand a professional-looking doctor's bag. The bag, however, was the
      only professional-looking thing about him. For the rest, he might have
      been taken to be either an impoverished country squire and sportsman, or a
      Roman Catholic dignitary, according to whether you assessed him by his
      broad, well-knit figure and weather-beaten complexion, puckered with
      wrinkles born of jolly laughter, or by the somewhat austere and controlled
      set of his mouth and by the ardent luminous grey eyes, with their touch of
      the visionary and fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara set down her cup hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm sure you're Dr. Selwyn," she said, a flicker of amusement at his
      unconventional greeting in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right!" he answered, shaking hands. "How are you, Miss Tennant? It was
      plucky of you to decide to risk us after all, and I hope&mdash;" with a
      slight grimace&mdash;"you won't find we are any worse than I depicted. I
      was very sorry I had to be out when you came," he went on genially, "but I
      expect Molly has looked after you all right? By the way"&mdash;glancing
      round him in some perplexity&mdash;"where <i>is</i> Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood," replied Sara tranquilly, "that she had gone in to
      Oldhampton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Selwyn's expression was not unlike that of a puppy caught in the
      unlawful possession of his master's slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I warn you?" he exclaimed with a rueful laugh. "We're quite a
      hopeless household, I'm afraid. And Molly's the most absent-minded of
      beings. I expect she has clean forgotten that you were coming to-day.
      She's by way of being an artist&mdash;art-student, rather"&mdash;correcting
      himself with a smile. "You know the kind of thing&mdash;black carpets and
      Futurist colour schemes in dress. So you must try and forgive her. She's
      only seventeen. But Jane&mdash;I hope Jane did the honours properly? She
      is our stand-by in all emergencies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I came upon Jane entirely in the light of an unpleasant
      surprise," she responded mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Do you mean to say she wasn't prepared for you? Oh, but this is
      scandalous! What must you think of us all?" he strode across the room and
      pealed the bell, and, when Jane appeared in answer to the summons,
      demanded wrathfully why nothing was in readiness for Miss Tennant's
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane surveyed him with the immovable calm of the old family servant, her
      arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how should it be?" she wanted to know. "Seeing that neither you nor
      Miss Molly named it to me that the young lady was coming to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I asked Miss Molly to make arrangements," protested Selwyn feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you expect her to do so, sir, may I ask?" inquired Jane with
      withering scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me that Miss Molly gave you no orders about preparing
      a room?" countered the doctor, skillfully avoiding the point raised?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, she didn't. And if I'm kep' here talking much longer, there
      won't <i>be</i> one prepared, neither! 'Tis no use crying over spilt milk.
      Let me get on with the airing of my sheets, and do you talk to the young
      lady whiles I see to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jane departed forthwith about her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane Crab," observed Selwyn, twinkling, "has been with us five-and-twenty
      years. I had better do as she tells me." He threw a doleful glance at the
      unappetizing tea in Sara's cup. "I positively dare not order you fresh tea&mdash;in
      the circumstances. Jane would probably retaliate with an ultimatum
      involving a rigid choice between tea and the preparation of your room,
      accompanied by a pithy summary of the capabilities of one pair of hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you like some tea yourself?" hazarded Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should&mdash;very much. But I see no prospect of getting any while Jane
      maintains her present attitude of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;if you will show me the kitchen&mdash;<i>I'll</i> make some,"
      announced Sara valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn regarded her with a pitying smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know Jane," he said. "Trespassers in the kitchen are not&mdash;welcomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jane doesn't know <i>me</i>," replied Sara firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your own head be it, then," retorted the doctor, and led the way to
      the sacrosanct domain presided over by Jane Crab.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Sara managed it Selwyn never knew, but she contrived to invade Jane's
      kitchen and perform the office of tea-making without offending her in the
      very least. Nay, more, by some occult process known only to herself, she
      succeeded in winning Jane's capacious heart, and from that moment onwards,
      the autocrat of the kitchen became her devoted satellite; and later, when
      Sara started to make drastic changes in the slip-shod arrangements of the
      house, her most willing ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Tennant's the only body in the place as has got some sense in her
      head," she was heard to observe on more than one occasion.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SKELETON IN SELWYN'S CUPBOARD
    </h3>
    <p>
      After tea, Selwyn escorted Sara upstairs and introduced her to his wife.
      Mrs. Selwyn was a slender, colourless woman, possessing the remnants of
      what must at one time have been an ineffective kind of prettiness. She was
      a determinedly chronic invalid, and rarely left the rooms which had been
      set aside for her use to join the other members of the family downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stairs try my heart, you see," she told Sara, with the martyred air
      peculiar to the hypochondriac&mdash;the genuine sufferer rarely has it.
      "It is, of course, a great deprivation to me, and I don't think either
      Dick"&mdash;with an inimical glance at her husband&mdash;"or Molly come up
      to see me as often as they might. Stairs are no difficulty to <i>them</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn, who invariably ran up to see his wife immediately on his return
      from no matter how long or how tiring a round of professional visits, bit
      his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come as often as I can, Minnie," he said patiently. "You must remember
      my time is not my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear, of course not. And I expect that outside patients are much more
      interesting to visit than one's own wife," with a disagreeable little
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They mean bread-and-butter, anyway," said Selwyn bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course they do." She turned to Sara. "Dick always thinks in terms of
      bread-and-butter, Miss Tennant," she said sneeringly. "But money means
      little enough to any one with my poor health. Beyond procuring me a few
      alleviations, there is nothing it can do for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was privately of the opinion that it had done a good deal for her.
      Looking round the luxuriously furnished room with its blazing fire, and
      then at Mrs. Selwyn herself, elegantly clad in a rest-gown of rich silk,
      she could better understand the poverty-stricken appearance of the rest of
      the house, Dick's shabby clothes, and his willingness to receive a paying
      guest whose contribution towards the housekeeping might augment his
      slender income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, was where his hard-earned guineas went&mdash;to keep in luxury
      this petulant, complaining woman whose entire thoughts were centred about
      her own bodily comfort, and whom Patrick Lovell, with his lucid
      recognition of values, would have contemptuously described as "a parasite
      woman, m'dear&mdash;the kind of female I've no use for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Dick"&mdash;Mrs. Selwyn had been turning over the pages of a
      price-list that was lying on her knee&mdash;"I see the World's Store have
      just brought out a new kind of adjustable reading-table. It's a much
      lighter make than the one I have. I think I should find it easier to use."
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn's face clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much does it cost, dear?" he asked nervously. "These mechanical
      contrivances are very expensive, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, this one isn't. It's only five guineas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five guineas is rather a lot of money, Minnie," he said gravely.
      "Couldn't you manage with the table you have for a bit longer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Selwyn tossed the price-list pettishly on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of, of course!" she declared. "That's always the way. 'Can't I manage
      with what I have? Can't I make do with this, that, and the other?' I
      believe you grudge every penny you spend on me!" she wound up
      acrimoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull red crept into Selwyn's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it's not that, Minnie," he replied in a painfully controlled
      voice. "It's simply that I <i>can't afford</i> these things. I give you
      everything I can. If I were only a rich man, you should have everything
      you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps if you were to work a little more intelligently you'd make more
      money," she retorted. "If only you'd keep your brains for the use of
      people who can <i>pay</i>&mdash;and pay well&mdash;I shouldn't be deprived
      of every little comfort I ask for! Instead of that, you've got half the
      poor of Monkshaven on your hands&mdash;and if you think they can't afford
      to pay, you simply don't send in a bill. Oh, <i>I</i> know!"&mdash;sitting
      up excitedly in her chair, a patch of angry scarlet staining each cheek&mdash;"I
      hear what goes on&mdash;even shut away from the world as I am. It's just
      to curry popularity&mdash;you get all the praise, and I suffer for it! <i>I</i>
      have to go without what I want&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hush! Hush!" Selwyn tried ineffectually to stem the torrent of
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't hush! It's 'Doctor Dick this,' and 'Doctor Dick that'&mdash;oh,
      yes, you see, I know their name for you, these slum patients of yours!&mdash;but
      it's Doctor Dick's wife who really foots the bills&mdash;by going without
      what she needs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Minnie, be quiet!" Selwyn broke in sternly. "Remember Miss Tennant is
      present."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had got beyond the stage when the presence of a third person, even
      that of an absolute stranger, could be depended upon to exercise any
      restraining effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, since Miss Tenant's going to live here, the sooner she knows how
      things stand the better! She won't be here long without seeing how I'm
      treated"&mdash;her voice rising hysterically&mdash;"set on one side, and
      denied even the few small pleasures my health permits&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off in a storm of angry weeping, and Sara retreated hastily from
      the room, leaving husband and wife alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had barely regained the shabby sitting-room when the front door opened
      and closed with a bang, and a gay voice could be heard calling&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane! Jane! Come here, my pretty Jane! I've brought home some shrimps for
      tea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your noise, Miss Molly, now do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could hear Jane's admonitory whisper, and there followed a murmured
      colloquy, punctuated by exclamations and gusts of young laughter, calling
      forth renewed remonstrance from Jane, and then the door of the room was
      flung open, and Molly Selwyn sailed in and overwhelmed Sara with apologies
      for her reception, or rather, for the lack of it. She was quite charming
      in her penitence, waving dimpled, deprecating hands, and appealing to Sara
      with a pair of liquid, disarming, golden-brown eyes that earned her
      forgiveness on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a statuesque young creature, compact of large, soft, gracious
      curves and swaying movements&mdash;with her nimbus of pale golden hair,
      and curiously floating, undulating walk, rather reminding one of a stray
      goddess. Always untidy with hooks lacking at important junctures, and the
      trimmings of her hats usually pinned on with a casualness that
      occasionally resulted in their deserting the hat altogether, she could
      still never be other than delightful and irresistibly desirable to look
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her red, curving mouth of a child, cleft chin, and dimpled, tapering hands
      all promised a certain yieldingness of disposition&mdash;a tendency to
      take always the line of least resistance&mdash;but it was a charming,
      appealing kind of frailty which most people&mdash;the sterner sex,
      certainly&mdash;would be very ready to condone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a wonderful thing to be young. Molly poured herself out a cup of
      hideously stewed tea and drank it joyously to an accompaniment of shrimps
      and bread-and-butter, and when Sara uttered a mild protest, she only
      laughed and declared that it was a wholesome and digestible diet compared
      with some of the "studio teas" perpetrated by the artists' colony at
      Oldhampton, of which she was a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chattered away gaily to Sara, giving her vivacious thumb-nail
      portraits of her future neighbours&mdash;the people Selwyn had described
      as being "much nicer than ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Herricks and Audrey Maynard are our most intimate friends&mdash;I'm
      sure you'll adore them. Mrs. Maynard is a widow, and if she weren't so
      frightfully rich, Monkshaven would be perennially shocked at her. She is
      ultra-fashionable, and smokes whenever she chooses, and swears when
      ordinary language fails her&mdash;all of which things, of course, are
      anathema to the select circles of Monkshaven. But then she's a
      millionaire's widow, so instead of giving her the cold shoulder, every one
      gushes round her and declares 'Mrs. Maynard is such a thoroughly <i>modern</i>
      type, you know!'"&mdash;Molly mimicked the sugar-and-vinegar accents of
      the critics to perfection&mdash;"and privately Audrey shouts with laughter
      at them, while publicly she continues to shock them for the sheer joy of
      the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who are the Herricks?" asked Sara, smiling. "Married people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Molly shook her head. "Miles is a bachelor who lives with a maiden
      aunt&mdash;Miss Lavinia. Or, rather, she lives with him and housekeeps for
      him. 'The Lavender Lady,' I always call her, because she's one of those
      delightful old-fashioned people who remind one of dimity curtains, and
      pot-pourri, and little muslin bags of lavender. Miles is a perfect pet,
      but he's lame, poor dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara waited with a curious eagerness for any description which might seem
      to fit her recent fellow-traveller, but none came, and at last she threw
      out a question in the hope of eliciting his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was horribly ungracious and rude," she added, "and yet he didn't look
      in the least the sort of man who would be like that. There was no lack of
      breeding about him. He was just deliberately snubby&mdash;as though I had
      no right to exist on the same planet with him&mdash;anyway"&mdash;laughing&mdash;"not
      in the same railway compartment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly nodded sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I know whom you mean. Was he a lean, brown, grim-looking
      individual, with the kind of eyes that almost make you jump when they look
      at you suddenly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That certainly describes them," admitted Sara, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it was the Hermit of Far End," announced Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Hermit of Far End?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He's a queer, silent man who lives all by himself at a house built
      almost on the edge of Monk's Cliff&mdash;you must have seen it as you
      drove up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed Sara, with sudden enlightenment. "Then his name is Trent.
      The cabman presented me with that information," she added, in answer to
      Molly's look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Garth Trent. It's rather an odd name&mdash;sounds like a
      railway collision, doesn't it? But it suits him somehow"&mdash;reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you met him?" prompted Sara. It was odd how definite an interest her
      brief encounter with him had aroused in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;once. He treated me"&mdash;giggling delightedly&mdash;"rather
      as if I <i>wasn't there</i>! At least"&mdash;reminiscently&mdash;"he tried
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't sound as though he had succeeded?" suggested Sara, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly looked at her solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told some one afterwards&mdash;Miles Herrick, the only man he ever
      speaks to, I think, without compulsion&mdash;that I was 'the Delilah type
      of woman, and ought to have been strangled at birth.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be a charming person," commented Sara ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's a woman-hater&mdash;in fact, I believe he has a grudge against
      the world in general, but woman in particular. I expect"&mdash;shrewdly&mdash;"he's
      been crossed in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Selwyn re-entered the room, his grave face clearing a
      little as he caught sight of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Molly mine! Got back, then?" he said, smiling. "Have you made your
      peace with Miss Tennant, you scatterbrained young woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a hereditary taint, Dad&mdash;don't blame <i>me</i>!" retorted Molly
      with lazy impudence, pulling his head down and kissing him on the top of
      his ruffled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pass," he submitted. "And who is it that's been crossed in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Hermit of Far End."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh"&mdash;turning to Sara&mdash;"so you have been discussing our local
      enigma?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I fancy I must have travelled down with him from Oldhampton. He
      seemed rather a boorish individual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would be. He doesn't like women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monk's Cliff would appear to be an appropriate habitation for him, then,"
      commented Sara tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and presently Selwyn suggested that his daughter should
      run up and see her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll be hurt if you don't go up, kiddy," he said. "And try and be very
      nice to her&mdash;she's a little tired and upset to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had left the room he turned to Sara, a curious blending of proud
      reluctance and regret in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry, Miss Tennant," he said simply, "that you should have seen
      our worst side so soon after your arrival. You&mdash;you must try and
      pardon it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, please don't apologize," broke in Sara hastily. "I'm so sorry
      I happened to be there just then. It was horrible for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very kind of you to take it like that," he said. "After all"&mdash;frankly&mdash;"you
      could not have remained with us very long without finding out our
      particular skeleton in the cupboard. My wife's state of health&mdash;or,
      rather, what she believes to be her state of health&mdash;is a great grief
      to me. I've tried in every way to convince her that she is not really so
      delicate as she imagines, but I've failed utterly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the ice was broken, he seemed to find relief in pouring out the
      pitiful little tragedy of his home life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is comparatively young, you know, Miss Tennant&mdash;only
      thirty-seven, and she willfully leads the life of a confirmed invalid. It
      has grown upon her gradually, this absorption in her health, and now,
      practically speaking, Molly has no mother and I no wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Doctor Dick"&mdash;the little nickname, that had its origin in his
      slum patients' simple affection for the man who tended them, came
      instinctively from her lips. It seemed, somehow, to fit itself to the big,
      kindly man with the sternly rugged face and eyes of a saint. "Oh, Doctor
      Dick, I'm so sorry&mdash;so very sorry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps something in the dainty, well-groomed air of the woman beside him
      helped to accentuate the neglected appearance of the room, for he looked
      round in an irritated kind of way, as though all at once conscious of its
      deficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this&mdash;this, too," he muttered. "There's no one at the helm. . .
      . The truth is, I ought never to have let you come here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've very glad I came," she said simply. "I think I'm going to be very
      happy here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got grit," he replied quietly. "You'd make a success of your life
      anywhere. I wish"&mdash;thoughtfully&mdash;"Molly had a little of that
      same quality. Sometimes"&mdash;a worried frown gathered on his face&mdash;"I
      get afraid for Molly. She's such a child . . . and no mother to hold the
      reins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor Dick, would you consider it impertinent if&mdash;if I laid my
      hands on the reins&mdash;just now and then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He whirled round, his eyes shining with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impertinent! I should be illimitably thankful! You can see how things are&mdash;I
      am compelled to be out all my time, my wife hardly ever leaves her own
      rooms, and Molly and the house affairs just get along as best they can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Sara, smiling, "I shall put my finger in the pie. I've&mdash;I've
      no one to look after now, since Uncle Patrick died," she added. "I think,
      Doctor Dick, I've found my job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's absurd!" he exclaimed, regarding her with unfeigned delight. "Here
      you come along, prepared, no doubt, to be treated as a 'guest,' and the
      first thing I do is to shovel half my troubles on to your shoulders. It's
      absurd&mdash;disgraceful! . . . But it's amazingly good!" He held out his
      hand, and as Sara's slim fingers slid into his big palm, he muttered a
      trifle huskily: "God bless you for it, my dear!"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TRESPASS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara stood on the great headland known as Monk's Cliff, watching with
      delight the white-topped billows hurling themselves against its mighty
      base, only to break in a baulked fury of thunder and upflung spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had climbed the steep ascent thither on more than one day of storm and
      bluster, reveling in the buffeting of the gale and in the pungent tang of
      brine from the spray-drenched air. The cry of the wind, shrieking along
      the face of the sea-bitten cliff, reminded her of the scream of the
      hurricane as it tore through the pinewoods at Barrow&mdash;shaking their
      giant tops hither and thither as easily as a child's finger might shake a
      Canterbury bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something wild and untamed within her responded to the savage movement of
      the scene, and she stood for a long time watching the expanse of restless,
      wind-tossed waters, before turning reluctantly in the direction of home.
      If for nothing else than for this gift of glorious sea and cliff, she felt
      she could be content to pitch her tent in Monkshaven indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her way led past Far End, the solitary house perched on the sloping side
      of the headland, and, as she approached, she became aware of a curious
      change of character in the sound of the wind. She was sheltered now from
      its fiercest onslaught, and it seemed to her that it rose and fell,
      moaning in strange, broken cadences, almost like the singing of a violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, thinking at first that this was due to the wind's
      whining through some narrow passage betwixt the outbuildings of the house,
      then, as the chromatic wailing broke suddenly into vibrating harmonies,
      she realized that some one actually <i>was</i> playing the violin, and
      playing it remarkably well, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she yielded to the fascination of it, and, drawing nearer to
      the house, leaned against a sheltered wall, all her senses subordinate to
      that of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever the musician might be, he was a thorough master of his instrument,
      and Sara listened with delight, recognizing some of the haunting melodies
      of the wild Russian music which he was playing&mdash;music that even in
      its moments of delirious joy seemed to hold always an underlying <i>bourdon</i>
      of tragedy and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started violently. Entirely absorbed in the music, she had failed to
      observe a man, dressed in the style of an indoor servant, who had appeared
      in the doorway of one of the outbuildings and who now addressed her in
      peremptory tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, there! Don't you know you're trespassing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerked suddenly out of her dreamy enjoyment, Sara looked round vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know that Monk's Cliff was private property," she said after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor is it, that I know of. But you're on the Far End estate now&mdash;this
      is a private road," replied the man disagreeably. "You'll please to take
      yourself off."
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush of indignation crept up under the warm pallor of Sara's
      skin. Then, a sudden thought striking her, she asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that playing the violin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentally she envisioned a pair of sensitive, virile hands, lean and brown,
      with the short, well-kept nails that any violinist needs must have&mdash;the
      contradictory hands which had aroused her interest on the journey to
      Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't hear no one playing," replied the man stolidly. She felt certain
      he was lying, but he gave her no opportunity for further interrogation,
      for he continued briskly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now, miss, please to move off from here. Trespassers aren't
      allowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara spoke with a quiet air of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I'll go," she said. "I'm sorry. I had no idea that I was
      trespassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's truculent manner softened, as, with the intuition of his kind,
      he recognized in the composed little apology the utterance of one of his
      "betters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beggin' your pardon, miss," he said, with a considerable accession of
      civility, "but it's as much as my place is worth to allow a trespasser
      here on Far End."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're perfectly right to obey orders," she said, and bending her steps
      towards the public road from which she had strayed to listen to the unseen
      musician, she made her way homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mysterious 'Hermit' is nothing if not thorough," she told Doctor
      Dick and Molly on her return. "I trespassed on to the Far End property
      to-day, and was ignominiously ordered off by a rather aggressive person,
      who, I suppose, is Mr. Trent's servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be Judson," nodded Selwyn. "I've attended him once or twice
      professionally. The fellow's all right, but he's under strict orders, I
      believe, to allow no trespassers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it seems," returned Sara. "By the way, who is the violinist at Far
      End? Is it the 'Hermit' himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rumoured that he does play," said Molly. "But no one has ever been
      privileged to hear him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their loss, then," commented Sara shortly. "I should say he is a
      magnificent performer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly nodded, an expression of impish amusement in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the sole occasion I met him, I asked him why no one was ever allowed
      to hear him play," she said, chuckling. "I even suggested that he might
      contribute a solo to the charity concert we were getting up at the time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did he say?" asked Sara, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told me that there was no need for a man to exhibit his soul to the
      public! So I asked him what he meant, and he said that if I understood
      anything about music I would know, and that if I didn't, it was a waste of
      his time trying to explain. Do <i>you</i> know what he meant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Sara slowly, "I think I do." And recalling the passionate
      appeal and sadness of the music she had heard that afternoon, she was
      conscious of a sudden quick sense of pity for the solitary hermit of Far
      End. He was <i>afraid</i>&mdash;afraid to play to any one, lest he should
      reveal some inward bitterness of his soul to those who listened!
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day, Molly carried Sara off to Rose Cottage to make the
      acquaintance of "the Lavender Lady" and her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Herrick&mdash;or Miss Lavinia, as she was invariably addressed&mdash;looked
      exactly as though she had just stepped out of the early part of last
      century. She wore a gown of some soft, silky material, sprigged with
      heliotrope, and round her neck a fichu of cobwebby lace, fastened at the
      breast with a cameo brooch of old Italian workmanship. A coquettish little
      lace cap adorned the silver-grey hair, and the face beneath the cap was
      just what you would have expected to find it&mdash;soft and very gentle,
      its porcelain pink and white a little faded, the pretty old eyes a misty,
      lavender blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone when the two girls arrived, and greeted Sara with a humorous
      little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How kind of you to come, Miss Tennant! We've been all agog to meet you,
      Miles and I. In a tiny place like Monkshaven, you see, every one knows
      every one else's business, so of course we have been hearing of you
      constantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you might have come to Sunnyside to investigate me personally,"
      replied Sara, smiling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia's face sobered suddenly, a shadow falling across her kind old
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miles is&mdash;rather difficult about calling," she said hesitatingly.
      "You will understand&mdash;his lameness makes him a little self-conscious
      with strangers," she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Perhaps it would have been better if I had not come?" she suggested
      hastily. "Shall I run away and leave Molly here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia flushed rose-pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I hope Miles knows how to welcome a guest in his own house as
      befits a Herrick," she said, with a delicious little air of old-world
      dignity. "Indeed, it is an excellent thing for him to be dragged out of
      his shell. Only, please&mdash;will you remember?&mdash;treat him exactly
      as though he were not lame&mdash;never try to help him in any way. It is
      that which hurts him so badly&mdash;when people make allowances for his
      lameness. Just ignore it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded. She could understand that instinctive man's pride which
      recoiled from any tolerant recognition of a physical handicap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was his lameness caused by an accident?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It came through a very splendid deed." Little Miss Lavinia's eyes glowed
      as she spoke. "He stopped a pair of runaway carriage-horses. They had
      taken fright at a motor-lorry, and, when they bolted, the coachman was
      thrown from the box, so that it looked as if nothing could save the
      occupants of the carriage. Miles flung himself at the horses' heads, and
      although, of course, he could not actually stop them single-handed, he so
      impeded their progress that a second man, who sprang forward to help, was
      able to bring them to a standstill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How plucky of him!" exclaimed Sara warmly. "You must be very proud of
      your nephew, Miss Lavinia!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is," interpolated Molly affectionately. "Aren't you, dear Lavender
      Lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia smiled a trifle wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! My dear," she said sadly, "splendid things are done at such a cost,
      and when they are over we are apt to forget the splendour and remember
      only the heavy price. . . . My poor Miles was horribly injured&mdash;he
      had been dragged for yards, clinging to the horses' bridles&mdash;and for
      weeks we were not even sure if he would live. He has lived&mdash;but he
      will walk lame to the end of his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little instinctive silence which followed was broken by the sound of
      voices in the hall outside, and, a minute later, Miles Herrick himself
      came into the room, escorting a very fashionably attired and distinctly
      attractive woman, whom Sara guessed at once to be Audrey Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not in the least pretty, but the narrowest of narrow skirts in
      vogue in the spring of 1914 made no secret of the fact that her figure was
      almost perfect. Her face was small and thin and inclined to be sallow, and
      beneath upward-slanting brows, to which art had undoubtedly added
      something, glimmered a pair of greenish-grey eyes, clear like rain. Nor
      was there any mistaking the fact that the rich copper-colour of the hair
      swathed beneath the smart little hat had come out of a bottle, and was in
      no way to be accredited to nature. It was small wonder that primitive
      Monkshaven stood aghast at such flagrant tampering with the obvious
      intentions of Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notwithstanding her up-to-date air of artificiality, there was
      something immensely likeable about Audrey Maynard. Behind it all, Sara
      sensed the real woman&mdash;clever, tactful, and generously warm-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woman, when all is said and done, is frankly primitive in her instincts,
      and the desire to attract&mdash;with all its odd manifestations&mdash;is
      really but the outcome of her innate desire for home and a mate. It is
      this which lies at the root of most of her little vanities and weaknesses&mdash;and
      of all the big sacrifices of which she is capable as well. So she may be
      forgiven the former, and trusted to fall short but rarely of the latter
      when the crucial test comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miles and I have been&mdash;as usual&mdash;squabbling violently,"
      announced Mrs. Maynard. "Sugar, please&mdash;lots of it," she added, as
      Herrick handed her her tea. "It was about the man who lives at Far End,"
      she continued in reply to the Lavender Lady's smiling query. "Miles has
      been very irritating, and tried to smash all my suggested theories to
      bits. He insists that the Hermit is quite a commonplace, harmless young
      man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be at least forty," interposed Herrick mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey frowned him into silence and continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that's so dull, when half Monkshaven believes him to be a villain of
      the deepest dye, hiding from justice&mdash;or, possibly, a Bluebeard with
      an unhappy wife imprisoned somewhere in that weird old house of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara listened with undignified interest. It was strange how the
      enigmatical personality of the owner of Far End kept cropping up across
      her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is your own opinion, Mrs. Maynard?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey flashed her a keen glance from her rain-clear eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he's a&mdash;sphinx," she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Sphinx was a lady," objected Herrick pertinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Trent's a masculine re-incarnation of her, then," retorted Mrs.
      Maynard, undefeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick smiled tolerantly. He was a tall, slenderly built man, with
      whimsical brown eyes and the half-stern, half-sweet mouth of one who has
      been through the mill of physical pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Homme incompris</i>," he suggested lightly. "Give the fellow his due&mdash;he
      at least supplies the feminine half of Monkshaven with a topic of
      perennial interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey took up the implied challenge with enthusiasm, and the two of them
      wrangled comfortably together till tea was over. Then she demanded a
      cigarette&mdash;and another cushion&mdash;and finally sent Miles in search
      of some snapshots they had taken together and which he had developed since
      last they had met. She treated him exactly as though he suffered no
      handicap, demanding from him all the little services she would have asked
      from a man who was physically perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara herself, accustomed to anticipating every need of Patrick Lovell's,
      would have been inclined to feel somewhat compunctious over allowing a
      lame man to wait upon her, yet, as she watched the eager way in which
      Miles responded to the visitor's behests, she realized that in reality
      Audrey was behaving with supreme tact. She let Miles feel himself a man as
      other men, not a mere "lame duck" to whom indulgence must needs be
      granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once, when her hair just brushed his cheek, as he stooped over her to
      indicate some special point in one of the recently developed photos, Sara
      surprised a sudden ardent light in his quiet brown eyes that set her
      wondering whether possibly, the incessant sparring between Herrick and the
      lively, impulsive woman who shocked half Monkshaven, did not conceal
      something deeper than mere friendship.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE UNWILLING HOST
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was one of those surprisingly warm days, holding a foretaste of June's
      smiles, which March occasionally vouchsafes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun blazed down out of a windless, cloudless sky, and Sara, making her
      way leisurely through the straggling woods that intervened betwixt the
      Selwyns' house and Monk's Cliff, felt the salt-laden air wafted against
      her face, as warmly mellow as though summer were already come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly had gone to Oldhampton&mdash;since the artists' colony there would
      be certain to take advantage of this gift of a summer's day to arrange a
      sketching party, and, as the morning's post had brought Sara a letter from
      Elisabeth Durward which had occasioned her considerable turmoil of spirit,
      she had followed her natural bent by seeking the solitude of a lonely
      tramp in order to think the matter out.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her earliest days at Barrow she had always carried the small tangles
      of childhood to a remote corner of the pine-woods for solution, and the
      habit had grown with her growth, so that now, when a rather bigger tangle
      presented itself, she turned instinctively to the solitude of the cliffs
      at Monkshaven, where the murmur of the sea was borne in her ears,
      plaintively reminiscent of the sound of the wind in her beloved pine
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring comes early in the sheltered, southern bay of Monkshaven, and
      already the bracken was sending up pushful little shoots of young green,
      curled like a baby's fist, while the primroses, bunched together in
      clusters, thrust peering faces impertinently above the green carpet of the
      woods. Sara stopped to pick a handful, tucking them into her belt. Then,
      emerging from the woods, she breasted the steep incline that led to the
      brow of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big boulder, half overgrown with moss and lichen, offered a tempting
      resting-place, and flinging herself down on the yielding turf beside it,
      she leaned back and drew out Elisabeth's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sometimes wondered whether Elisabeth had any suspicion of the fact
      that, before leaving Barrow, she had refused to marry Tim. The friendship
      and understanding between mother and son was so deep that it was very
      possible that Tim had taken her into his confidence. And even if he had
      not, the eyesight of love is extraordinarily keen, and Elisabeth would
      almost inevitably have divined that something was amiss with his
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were so, as Sara admitted to herself with a wry smile, there was
      little doubt that she would look askance at the woman who had had the
      temerity to refuse her beautiful Tim!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, although her letter contained no definite allusion to the matter,
      reading between the lines, the conviction was borne in upon Sara that
      Elisabeth knew all that there was to know, and had ranged herself, heart
      and soul, on the side of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious that she thought of the whole world in terms of Tim, and,
      had she been a different type of woman, the simile of a hen with one chick
      would have occurred to Sara's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was nothing in the least hen-like about Elisabeth Durward. Only,
      whenever Tim came near her, her face, with its strangely inscrutable eyes,
      would irradiate with a sudden warmth and tenderness of emotion that was
      akin to the exquisite rapture of a lover when the beloved is near. To
      Sara, there seemed something a little frightening&mdash;almost terrible&mdash;in
      her intense devotion to Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter itself was charmingly written&mdash;expressing the hope that
      Sara was happy and comfortable at Monkshaven, recalling their pleasant
      time at Barrow together, and looking forward to other future visits from
      her&mdash;"<i>which would be a fulfillment of happiness to us all</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this last sentence, combined with one or two other phrases into
      which much or little meaning might equally as easily be read, which had
      aroused in Sara a certain uneasy instinct of apprehension. Dimly she
      sensed a vague influence at work to strengthen the ties that bound her to
      Barrow, and to all that Barrow signified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She faced the question with characteristic frankness. Tim had his own
      place in her heart&mdash;secure and unassailable. But it was not the place
      in that sacred inner temple which is reserved for the one man, and she
      recognized this with a limpid clearness of perception rather uncommon in a
      girl of twenty. She also recognized that it was within the bounds of
      possibility that the one man might never come to claim that place, and
      that, if she gave Tim the answer he so ardently desired, they would quite
      probably rub along together as well as most married folk&mdash;better,
      perhaps, than a good many. But she was very sure that she never intended
      to desecrate that inner temple by any lesser substitute for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she reasoned, with the untried confidence of youth, which is so
      pathetically certain of itself and of its ultimate power to hold to its
      ideals, ignorant of the overpowering influences which may develop to push
      a man or woman this way or that, or of the pain that may turn clear,
      definite thought into a welter of blind anguish, when the soul in its
      agony snatches at any anodyne, true or false, which may seem to promise
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little irritably she folded up Elisabeth's letter. It was disquieting in
      some ways&mdash;she could not quite explain why&mdash;and just now she
      felt averse to wrestling with disturbing ideas. She only wanted to lie
      still, basking in the tranquil peace of the afternoon, and listen to the
      murmuring voice of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes indolently, and presently, lulled by the drowsy rhythm
      of the waves breaking at the foot of the cliff, she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She woke with a start. An ominous drop of rain had splashed down on to her
      cheek, and she sat up, broad awake in an instant and shivering a little.
      It had turned much colder, and a wind had risen which whispered round her
      of coming storm, while the blue sky of an hour ago was hidden by heavy,
      platinum-coloured clouds massing up from the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another and another raindrop fell, and, obeying their warning, Sara sprang
      up and bent her steps in the direction of home. But she was too late to
      avoid the storm which had been brewing, and before she had gone a hundred
      yards it had begun to break in drifting scurries of rain, driven before
      the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried on, hoping to gain the shelter of the woods before the
      threatened deluge, but within ten minutes of the first heralding drops it
      was upon her&mdash;a torrent of blinding rain, sweeping across the upland
      like a wet sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her desperately, in search of cover, and perceiving, on
      the further side of a low stone wall, what she took to be a wooden shelter
      for cattle, she quickened her steps to a run, and, nimbly vaulting the
      wall, fled headlong into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, the cattle shed she had supposed it, but a roughly
      constructed summer-house, open on one side to the four winds of heaven and
      with a wooden seat running round the remaining three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara guessed immediately that she must have trespassed again on the Far
      End property, but reflecting that neither its owner nor his lynx-eyed
      servant was likely to be abroad in such a downpour as this, and that, even
      if they were, and chanced to discover her, they could hardly object to her
      taking refuge in this outlying shelter, she shook the rain from her skirts
      and sat down to await the lifting of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always in such circumstances, the time seemed to pass inordinately
      slowly, but in reality she had not been there more than a quarter of an
      hour before she observed the figure of a man emerge from some trees, a few
      hundred yards distant, and come towards her, and despite the fact that he
      was wearing a raincoat, with the collar turned up to his ears, and a tweed
      cap pulled well down over his head, she had no difficulty in recognizing
      in the approaching figure her fellow-traveller of the journey to
      Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he had not seen her, for she could hear him whistling softly to
      himself as he approached, while with the fingers of one hand he drummed on
      his chest as though beating out the rhythm of the melody he was whistling&mdash;a
      wild, passionate refrain from Wieniawski's exquisite <i>Legende</i>. It
      sounded curiously in harmony with the tempest that raged about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself, he appeared to regard the storm with indifference&mdash;almost
      to welcome it, for more than once Sara saw him raise his head as though he
      were glad to feel the wind and rain beating against his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back a little into the shadows of the summer-house, hoping he
      might turn aside without observing her, since, from all accounts, Garth
      Trent was hardly the type of man to welcome a trespasser upon his
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he came straight on towards her, and an instant later she knew that
      her presence was discovered, for he stopped abruptly and peered through
      the driving rain in the direction of the summer-house. Then, quickening
      his steps, he rapidly covered the intervening space and halted on the
      threshold of the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil&mdash;&mdash;" he began, then paused and stared down at
      her with an odd glint of amusement in his eyes. "So it's you, is it?" he
      said at last, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Sara was conscious of the extraordinary intensity of his
      regard, and now, as a sudden ragged gleam of sunlight pierced the clouds,
      falling athwart his face, she realized what it was that induced it. In
      both eyes the clear hazel of the iris was broken by a tiny, irregularly
      shaped patch of vivid blue, close to the pupil, and its effect was to give
      that curious depth and intentness of expression which Molly had tried to
      describe when she had said that Garth Trent's were the kind of eyes which
      "make you jump if he looked at you suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara almost jumped now; then, supported by her indignant recollection of
      the man's churlishness on a former occasion, she bowed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to regard her with that lurking suggestion of amusement at
      the back of his eyes, and she was annoyed to feel herself flushing
      uncomfortably beneath his scrutiny. At last he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have a faculty for intrusion," he remarked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, a fancy for solitude," she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly." He bowed ironically. "Perhaps you would oblige me by
      considering it?" And he drew politely aside as though to let her pass out
      in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara cast a dismayed glance at the rain, which was still descending in
      torrents. Then she turned to him indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you're going to insist on my starting out in this
      storm?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know that you've no right to be here at all&mdash;that you're
      trespassing?" he parried coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I know it! But I didn't expect that any one in the world would
      object to my trespassing in the circumstances!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not judge me by other people," he replied composedly. "I am not&mdash;like
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not, indeed," agreed Sara warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your tone implies 'thanks be,'" he supplemented with a faint smile.
      "Oh, well," he went on ungraciously, "stay if you like&mdash;so long as
      you don't expect me to stay with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara hastily disclaimed any such desire, and, lifting his cap, he turned
      and strode away into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ten minutes crawled by, and still the rain came down as
      persistently as though it intended never to cease again. Sara fidgeted,
      and walked across impatiently to the open front of the summer-house,
      staring up moodily at the heavy clouds. They showed no signs of breaking,
      and she was just about to resume her weary waiting on the seat within the
      shelter, when quick steps sounded to her left, and Garth Trent reappeared,
      carrying an umbrella and with a man's overcoat thrown over his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to rain for a good two hours yet," he said abruptly. "You'd
      better come up to the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara gazed at him in silent amazement; the invitation was so totally
      unexpected that for the moment she had no answer ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless," he added sneeringly, misinterpreting her silence, "you're afraid
      of the proprieties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm far more afraid of taking cold," she replied promptly, preparing to
      evacuate the summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, put this on," he said gruffly, holding out the coat he had brought
      with him. "There's no object in getting any wetter than you must."
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her into the coat, buttoning it carefully under her chin, his
      dexterous movements and quiet solicitude contrasting curiously with the
      detachment of his manner whilst performing these small services. He was so
      altogether business-like and unconcerned that Sara felt not unlike a child
      being dressed by a conscientious but entirely disinterested nurse. When he
      had fastened the last button of the long coat, which came down to her
      heels, he unfurled the umbrella and held it over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep close to me, please," he said briefly, nor did he volunteer any
      further remark until they had accomplished the journey to the house, and
      were standing together in the old-fashioned hall which evidently served
      him as a living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Trent relieved her of the coat, and while she stood warming her feet
      at the huge log-fire, blazing half-way up the chimney, he rang for his
      servant and issued orders for tea to be brought, as composedly as though
      visitors of the feminine persuasion were a matter of everyday occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, catching a glimpse of Judson's almost petrified face of astonishment
      as he retreated to carry out his master's instructions, and with a vivid
      recollection of her last encounter with him, almost laughed out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please sit down," said Trent. "And"&mdash;with a glance towards her feet&mdash;"you
      had better take off those wet shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in his curt manner of giving orders&mdash;rather as
      though he were a drill-sergeant, Sara reflected&mdash;that aroused her to
      opposition. She held out her feet towards the blaze of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," she replied airily. "They'll dry like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she glanced up and encountered a sudden flash in his eyes
      like the keen flicker of a sword-blade. Without vouchsafing any answer, he
      knelt down beside her and began to unlace her shoes, finally drawing them
      off and laying them sole upwards, in front of the fire to dry. Then he
      passed his hand lightly over her stockinged feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wringing wet!" he remarked curtly. "Those silk absurdities must come off
      as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she said firmly. "They shall not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, again with that glint of mocking amusement with which he
      had first greeted her presence in his summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd rather have a bad cold?" he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever so much rather!" retorted Sara hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a short laugh, almost as though he could not help himself, and,
      with a shrug of his shoulders, turned and marched out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Sara glanced about her in some surprise at the evidences of a
      cultivated taste and love of beauty which the room supplied. It was not
      quite the sort of abode she would have associated with the grim,
      misanthropic type of man she judged her host to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old-fashioned note, struck by the huge oaken beams supporting the
      ceiling and by the open hearth, had been retained throughout, and every
      detail&mdash;the blue willow-pattern china on the old oak dresser, the
      dimly lustrous pewter perched upon the chimney-piece, the silver
      candle-sconces thrusting out curved, gleaming arms from the paneled walls&mdash;was
      exquisite of its kind. It reminded her of the old hall at Barrow, where
      she and Patrick had been wont to sit and yarn together on winter evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place had a well-tended air, too, and Sara, who waged daily war
      against the slovenly shabbiness prevalent at Sunnyside, was all at once
      sensible of how desperately she had missed the quiet perfection of the
      service at Barrow. The nostalgia for her old home&mdash;the unquenchable,
      homesick longing for the <i>place</i> that has held one's happiness&mdash;rushed
      over her in a overwhelming flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing she had never come to this house, which had so stirred old
      memories, she got up restlessly, driven by a sudden impulse to escape,
      just as the door opened to re-admit Garth Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a swift, searching glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down again," he commanded. "There"&mdash;gravely depositing a towel
      and a pair of men's woolen socks on the floor beside her&mdash;"dry your
      feet and put those socks on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved quickly away towards the window and remained there, with his back
      turned studiously towards her, while she obeyed his instructions. When she
      had hung two very damp black silk stockings on the fire-dogs to dry, she
      flung a somewhat irritated glance at him over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can come back," she said in a small voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, and stood staring down at the two woolly socks protruding from
      beneath the short, tweed skirt. The suspicion of a smile curved his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're several sizes too large," he observed. "Odd creatures you women
      are," he went on suddenly, after a brief silence. "You shy wildly at the
      idea of letting a man see the foot God gave you, but you've no scruples at
      all about letting any one see the selfishness that the devil's put into
      your hearts."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a kind of savage contempt; it was as though the speech were
      tinged with some bitter personal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes surveyed him calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no intention of making an exhibit of my heart," she observed mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wiser not, probably," he retorted disagreeably, and at that moment
      Judson came into the room and began to arrange the tea-table beside his
      master's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it over there," directed Trent sharply, indicating with a gesture
      that the table should be placed near his guest, and Judson, his face
      manifesting rather more surprise than is compatible with the wooden mask
      demanded of the well-trained servant, hastened to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had readjusted the position of the tea-table, he moved quietly
      about the room, drawing the curtains and lighting the candles in their
      silver sconces, so that little pools of yellow light splashed down on to
      the smooth surface of the oak floor&mdash;waxed and polished till it
      gleamed like black ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he withdrew unobtrusively towards the door, Trent tossed him a further
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall want the car round in a couple of hours&mdash;at six," he said,
      and smiled straight into Sara's startled eyes.

    <h3>
      THE HERMIT'S SHELL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara paused with the sugar-tongs poised above the Queen Anne bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sugar?" she queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent regarded her seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One lump, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him his cup and poured out another for herself. Then she said
      lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard you order your car. Is this quite a suitable afternoon for
      joy-riding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More so than for walking," he retaliated. "I'm going to drive you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At six o'clock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At six o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And suppose I wish to leave before then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast an expressive glance towards the windows, where the rain could be
      heard beating relentlessly against the panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite up to you . . . to walk home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara made a small grimace of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Otherwise," she said tentatively, "I am going to stay here, whether I
      will or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It's my birthday, and I'm proposing to make myself a present of an
      hour or two of your society," he replied composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara regarded him with curiosity. He had been openly displeased to find
      her trespassing on his estate&mdash;which was only what current report
      would have led her to expect&mdash;yet now he was evincing a desire for
      her company, and, in addition, a very determined intention to secure it.
      The man was an enigma!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm surprised," she said lightly. "I gathered from a recent remark of
      yours that you didn't think too highly of women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't," he replied with uncompromising directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I have a fancy to drop back for a brief space into the life I
      have renounced," he suggested mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you really are what they call you&mdash;a hermit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And feminine society is taboo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely&mdash;as a rule." If, for an instant, the faintest of smiles
      modified the grim closing of his lips, Sara failed to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold detachment of his answer irritated her. It was as though he
      intended to remain, hermit-like, within his shell, and she had a suspicion
      that behind this barricade he was laughing at her for her ineffectual
      attempts to dig him out of it with a pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose some woman didn't fall into your arms just when you wanted her
      to?" she hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not calculated the result of this thrust. His eyes blazed for a
      moment. Then, a shade of contempt blending with the former cool
      insouciance of his tone, he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't expect an answer to that question, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The snub was unmistakable, and Sara's cheeks burned. She felt heartily
      ashamed of herself, and yet, incongruously, she was half inclined to lay
      the blame for her impertinent speech on his shoulders. He had almost
      challenged her to deal a blow that should crack that impervious shell of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced across at him beneath her lashes, and in an instant all
      thought of personal dignity was wiped out by the look of profound pain
      that she surprised in his face. Her shrewd question, uttered almost
      unthinkingly in the cut-and-thrust of repartee, had got home somewhere on
      an old wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sorry!" she exclaimed contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could only assume that he had not heard her low-voiced apology, for,
      when he turned to her again, he addressed her exactly as though she had
      not spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try some of these little hot cakes," he said, tendering a plateful. "They
      are quite one of Mrs. Judson's specialties."
    </p>
    <p>
      With amazing swiftness he had reassumed his mask. The bright, hazel eyes
      were entirely free from any hint of pain, and his voice held nothing more
      than conventional politeness. Sara meekly accepted one of the cakes in
      question, and for a little while the conversation ran on stereotyped
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, when tea was over, he offered her a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not forgotten your tastes, you see," he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do smoke," she admitted. "But"&mdash;the confession came with a rush,
      and she did not quite know what impelled her to make it&mdash;"I smoked&mdash;that
      day in the train&mdash;out of sheer defiance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was sure of it," he responded in amused tones. "But now"&mdash;striking
      a match and holding it for her to light her cigarette&mdash;"you will
      smoke because you really like it, and because it would be a friendly
      action and condone the fact that you are being held a prisoner against
      your will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very charming prison," she said, contemplating the harmony of the
      room with satisfied eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You like it?" he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in surprise. What could it matter to him whether she
      liked it or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course, I like it," she replied. "Who wouldn't? You see," she
      added a little wistfully, "I have no home of my own now, so I have to
      enjoy other people's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no home, either," he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but this&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the house in which I live. One wants more than a few sticks of
      furniture to make a home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was struck by the intense bitterness in his tone. Truly this man,
      with his lightning changes from boorish incivility to whole-hearted
      hospitality, from apparently impenetrable reserve to an almost desperate
      outspokenness, was as incomprehensible as any sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily steered the conversation towards a less dangerous channel, and
      gradually they drifted into the discussion of art and music; and Sara, not
      without some inward trepidation&mdash;remembering Molly's experience&mdash;touched
      on his own musicianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was surely you I herd?" she queried a trifle hesitatingly. "You were
      playing some Russian music that I knew. Your man ordered me off the
      premises"&mdash;smiling a little&mdash;"so I didn't hear as much as I
      should have liked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a hint?" he asked whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A broad one. Please take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and led the way into an adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the hall they had just quitted, it was pleasantly illumined by
      candles in silver sconces, and had evidently been arranged to serve
      exclusively as a music-room, for it contained practically no furniture
      beyond a couple of chairs, and a beautiful mahogany cabinet, of which the
      doors stood open, revealing sliding shelves crammed full of musical
      scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grand piano was so placed that the light from either window or candles
      would fall comfortably upon the music-desk; and on a stool beside it
      rested a violin case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent opened the case, and, lifting the violin from is cushiony bed of
      padded satin, fingered it caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you read accompaniments?" he asked, flashing the question at her with
      his usual abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." Sara's answer came simply, minus the mock-modest tag: "A little,"
      or "I'll do my best," which most people seem to think it incumbent on them
      to add, in the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the mysteries of convention why, when you are perfectly aware
      that you can do a thing, and do it well, you are expected to depreciate
      your capability under penalty of being accounted overburdened with conceit
      should you fail to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good." Trent pulled out an armful of music from the cabinet and looked
      through it rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have some of these." ("These" being several suites for violin and
      piano.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's lips twitched. He was testing her rather highly, since the
      pianoforte score of the suites in question was by no means easy. But,
      thanks to the wisdom of Patrick Lovell, who had seen to it that she
      studied under one of the finest masters of the day, she was not a musician
      by temperament alone, but had also a surprisingly good technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the second suite, Trent turned to her enthusiastically,
      his face aglow. For the moment he was no longer the hermit, aloof and
      enigmatical, but an eager comrade, spontaneously appealing to a congenial
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That went splendidly, didn't it?" he exclaimed. "The pianoforte score is
      a pretty stiff one, but I was sure"&mdash;smilingly&mdash;"from the
      downright way you answered my question about accompaniments, that you'd
      prove equal to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think it necessary to make any conventional professions of
      modesty&mdash;to you," she said. "You don't&mdash;wrap things up much&mdash;yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the piano, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Nothing I say can make things either better or worse for me, so I
      have at least gained freedom from the conventions. That is one of my few
      compensations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compensations for what?" The question escaped her almost before she was
      aware, and she waited for the snub which she felt would inevitably follow
      her second indiscretion that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not come. Instead, he fenced adroitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compensation for the limitations of a hermit's life," he said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The life is your own choice," she flashed back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, we're not always given a choice, you know. This world isn't a
      kind of sublimated children's party."
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," she said gravely, "we always get back out of life just what we
      put into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mouth twisted ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a charming doctrine, but I'm afraid I can't subscribe to it. I put
      in&mdash;all my capital. And I've drawn a blank."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone implied a kind of strange, numb acceptance of an inimical
      destiny, and Sara was conscious of a rush of intense pity towards this man
      whose implacably cynical outlook manifested itself in almost every word he
      uttered. It was no mere pose on his part&mdash;of that she felt assured&mdash;but
      something ingrained, grafted on to his very nature by the happenings of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather girlishly she essayed to combat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not at the end of life yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her&mdash;a sudden, rare smile of extraordinary sweetness.
      Her intention was so unmistakable&mdash;so touchingly ingenious, as are
      all youth's attempts to heal a bitterness that lies beyond its ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no more lucky dips left in life's tub for me, I'm afraid," he
      said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara seized upon the opening afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not&mdash;if you persist in keeping to the role of looker-on,"
      she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately, I've no longer any right to dip my head into the tub. Even
      if I chanced to draw a prize&mdash;I should only have to put it back
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet irrevocableness of his answer shook her optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;don't understand," she said hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"&mdash;his tones hardened suddenly. "It's just as well you shouldn't,
      perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt alteration in his manner took her by surprise. All at once, he
      seemed to have retreated into his shell, to have become again the curt,
      ironic individual of their first meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," he went on, tranquilly ignoring the mixture of chagrin and
      amazement in her face, "I think I hear the car coming round. You had
      better put on your shoes and stockings again&mdash;they'll be dry now&mdash;and
      then we can start. It's no longer raining."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara felt as though she had been suddenly relegated to a position of utter
      unimportance. He was showing her that, as far as he was concerned, she was
      a person of not the slightest consequence, treating her like an
      inquisitive child. Their recent conversation, during which his mantle of
      reserve had slipped a little aside, the music they had shared, when for a
      brief time they had walked together in the pleasant paths of mutual
      understanding, all seemed to have receded an immense distance away. As she
      took her place in the car, she could almost have believed that the
      incidents of the afternoon were a dream, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent sat silently beside her, his attention apparently concentrated on
      the driving of the car. Once he asked her if she were warm enough, and,
      upon her replying in the affirmative, lapsed again into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaining security from his abstraction, Sara ventured to steal a
      side-glance at his face. It was a curiously contradictory face, hard and
      bitter-looking, yet the reckless mouth curved sensitively at the corners,
      and the tolerant, humorous lines about the eyes seemed to combat the
      impression of almost brutal force conveyed by the frowning brows and
      square, dominant chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always acutely sensible of temperament, Sara felt as though the man beside
      her might be capable of any extreme of action. Whatever decision he might
      adopt over any given matter, he would hold by it, come what may, and she
      was aware of an odd reflex consciousness of feminine inadequacy. To
      influence Garth Trent against his convictions would be like trying to
      deflect the course of a river by laying a straw across its track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primitive woman in her thrilled a little, responsively, and she
      wondered whether or no her sex had played much part in his life. He was a
      woman-hater&mdash;so Molly had told her&mdash;yet Sara could imagine him
      in a very different role. Of one thing she was sure&mdash;that the woman
      who was loved by Garth Trent would anchor in no placid back-water. Life,
      for her, would hold something breathless, vital, exultant . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, have you decided yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ironical voice broke sharply into the midst of her fugitive thoughts,
      and Sara jumped violently, flushing scarlet as she found Trent's eyes
      surveying her with a quietly quizzical expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decided what?" she asked defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where to place me&mdash;whether among the sheep or the goats. You were
      dissecting my character, weren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for an answer, but Sara maintained an embarrassed silence. He
      had divined the subject of her thoughts too nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The decision has gone against me, I see. Well, I'm not surprised. I've
      certainly treated you with a rather rough-and-ready kind of courtesy. You
      must try to pardon me. A hermit gets little practice at entertaining
      angels unawares."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, recovering her composure, regarded him placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might find many opportunities for practice in Monkshaven," she
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Monkshaven? Are you trying to suggest that I should ingratiate myself
      with the leading lights of local society?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as though genuinely amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you've not been here long enough yet to discover that the amiable
      inhabitants of Monkshaven look upon me as a sort of cross between a madman
      and a criminal who has eluded justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose fault is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mine, I suppose"&mdash;quickly. "But it doesn't matter&mdash;since I
      regard them as a set of harmless, conventional fools. No, thank you, I've
      no intention of making friends with the people of Monkshaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're not all conventional. Some of them are rather interesting&mdash;Mrs.
      Maynard, for instance, and the Herricks."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a keen glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the Herricks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Why don't you go to see them sometimes? Miles&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miles Herrick's all right. I know that," he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very bad for you to cut yourself off from the rest of the world, as
      you do," persisted Sara sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a while, his eyes intent on the strip of road that
      stretched in front of him, and when he spoke again it was to draw her
      attention to the effect of the cloud shadows moving across the sea,
      exactly as though nothing of greater interest had been under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to recognize as a trick of his this abrupt method of terminating
      a conversation that for some reason did not please him. It was as
      conclusive as when the man at the other end of the 'phone suddenly "rings
      off" without any preliminary warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the steep hill that approached directly to
      the Selwyns' house, and a couple of minutes later, Trent brought the car
      to a standstill at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have nothing to thank me for," he said, curtly dismissing her
      expression of thanks as they stood together on the path. "It is I who
      should be grateful to you. My opportunities of social intercourse"&mdash;drily&mdash;"are
      somewhat limited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extend them, then, as I advised," retorted Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish me to?" he asked swiftly, and his intent eyes sought her face
      with a sudden hawk-like glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own eyes fell. She was conscious, all at once, of an inexplicable
      agitation, a tremulous confusion that made it seem a physical
      impossibility to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he still waited for his answer, and, at last, with an effort she
      mastered the nervousness that had seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I do wish it," she said faintly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MEETING AT ROSE COTTAGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      It had not taken Sara very long to cut a niche for herself in the
      household at Sunnyside. In a dwelling where the master of the house was
      away the greater part of the day, the mistress a chronic invalid, and the
      daughter a beautiful young thing whose mind was intent upon "colour" and
      "atmosphere," and altogether hazy concerning the practical necessities of
      housekeeping, the advent of any one possessing even half Sara's
      intelligent efficiency would have been provocative of many reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Selwyn, pushed to the uttermost limits of his strength by the demands
      of his wide practice and by the nervous strain of combating his wife's
      incessant fretfulness, quickly learned to turn to Sara for that
      sympathetic understanding which had hitherto been denied him in his
      home-life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, of course, never again discussed with her his wife's incurable
      self-absorption, as on the day of her arrival, when the painful scene
      created by Mrs. Selwyn had practically forced him into some sort of
      explanation, but Sara's quick grasp of the situation had infinitely
      simplified matters, and by devoting a considerable amount of her own time
      to the entertainment of the captious invalid, and thus keeping her in a
      good humour, she contrived to save Selwyn many a bad half-hour of
      recrimination and complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was essentially a good "comrade," as Patrick Lovell had recognized in
      the old days at Barrow Court, and instinctively Selwyn came to share with
      her the pin-prick worries that dog a man's footsteps in this vale of woe,
      learning to laugh at them; and even his apprehensions concerning Molly's
      ultimate development and welfare were lessened by the knowledge that Sara
      was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly herself seemed to float through life like a big, beautiful moth,
      sailing serenely along, and now and then blundering into things, but never
      learning by experience the dangers of such blunders. One day, in the
      course of her inconsequent path through life, she would probably flutter
      too near the attractive blaze of some perilous fire, just as a moth flies
      against the flame of a candle and singes its frail, soft wings in the
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of this that Sara was inwardly afraid, realizing, perhaps more
      clearly than the girl's overworked and sometimes absent-minded father, the
      risks attaching to her temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late, Molly had manifested a certain moodiness and irritability very
      unlike her usual facile sweetness of disposition, and Sara was somewhat
      nonplussed to account for it. Finally, she approached the matter by way of
      a direct inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong, Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly was hunched up in the biggest and shabbiest armchair by the fire,
      smoking innumerable cigarettes and flinging them away half-finished. At
      Sara's question, she looked up with a shade of defiance in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should anything be wrong?" she countered, obviously on the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I'm sure," responded Sara good-humouredly. "But I'm pretty
      certain there is something. Come, out with it, you great baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly sighed, smoked furiously for a moment, and then tossed her cigarette
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes," she admitted at last. "There is&mdash;something wrong." She
      rose and stood looking across at Sara like a big, perplexed child. "I&mdash;I
      owe some money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was conscious of a distinct shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?" she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's&mdash;it's rather a lot&mdash;twenty pounds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty pounds!" This was certainly a large sum for Molly&mdash;whose
      annual dress allowance totaled very little more&mdash;to be in debt. "What
      on earth have you been up to? Buying a new trousseau? Where do you owe it&mdash;Carr
      &amp; Bishop's?"&mdash;mentioning the principal draper's shop in
      Oldhampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I&mdash;don't owe it to a shop at all. It's&mdash;it's a bridge
      debt!" The confession came out rather hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's face grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Molly, you little fool, you've no business to be playing bridge.
      Where have you been playing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we play sometimes at the studios&mdash;when the light's too bad to go
      on painting, you know"&mdash;airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean," said Sara, "the artists' club people play?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara frowned. She knew that Molly was one of the youngest members of this
      club of rather irresponsible and happy-go-lucky folk, and privately
      considered that Selwyn had made a great mistake in ever allowing her to
      join it. It embodied, as she had discovered by inquiry, some of the most
      rapid elements of Oldhampton's society, and was, moreover, open to receive
      as temporary members artists who come from other parts of the country to
      paint in the neighbourhood. More than one well-known name had figured in
      the temporary membership list, and, in addition, the name of certain <i>dilettanti</i>
      to whom the freedom from convention of the artistic life signified far
      more that art itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," said Sara slowly, "how they let you go on playing
      until you owed twenty pounds. Don't you square up at the end of the
      afternoon's play?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But I'd&mdash;I'd been losing badly, and&mdash;and some one lent me
      the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly flushed a bewitching rose-colour and appealed with big, pathetic
      eyes. It was difficult to be righteously wroth with her, but Sara steeled
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd no right to borrow," she said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I know I hadn't. But, don't you see, I thought I should be sure to
      win it all back? I couldn't ask Dad for it. Every penny he can spare goes
      on something that mother can't possibly do without," added the girl with
      unwonted bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter fact was incontrovertible, and Sara remained silent. In her own
      mind she regarded Mrs. Selwyn as a species of vampire, sucking out all
      that was good, and sweet, and wholesome from the lives of those about her&mdash;even
      that of her own daughter. Did the woman realize, she wondered, that
      instead of being the help all mothers were sent into the world to be, she
      was nothing but a hindrance and a stumbling-block?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to do, I simply don't." Molly's humble, dejected tones
      broke through the current of Sara's thoughts. "You see, the worst of it
      is"&mdash;she blushed even more bewitchingly than before&mdash;"that I owe
      it to a <i>man</i>. It's detestable owing money to a man!"&mdash;with
      suppressed irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two fine lines drew themselves between Sara's level brows. This was worse
      than she had imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it?" she asked, at last, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lester Kent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who&mdash;or what&mdash;is Lester Kent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's&mdash;he's an artist&mdash;by choice. I mean," stumbled Molly, "that
      he's quite well off&mdash;he only paints for pleasure. He often runs down
      from town for a month or two at a time and takes out a temporary
      membership for our club."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he has lent you this money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes"&mdash;rather shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he must be paid back at once. At once, do you understand? I will
      give you the twenty pounds&mdash;you're not to bother your father about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Sara! You are a blessed duck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Molly's cares had slipped from her shoulders, and she beamed
      across at her deliverer with the most disarming gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment," continued Sara firmly. "You must never borrow from Mr.
      Kent&mdash;or any one else&mdash;again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I won't! Indeed, I won't!" Molly was fervent in her assurances. "I've
      been wretched over this. Although"&mdash;brightening&mdash;"Lester Kent
      was really most awfully nice about it. He said it didn't matter one bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he indeed?" Sara spoke rather grimly. "And how old is this Lester
      Kent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old? Oh"&mdash;vaguely&mdash;"thirty-five&mdash;forty, perhaps. I
      really don't know. Somehow he's not the sort of person whose age one
      thinks about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, he's old enough to know better than to be lending you money to
      play bridge with," commented Sara. "I wish you'd give up playing, Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I couldn't!" coaxingly. "We play for very small stakes&mdash;as a
      rule. But it <i>is</i> amusing, Sara. And, you know this place is as dull
      as ditchwater unless one does <i>something</i>. But I won't get into debt
      again&mdash;I really won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly had all the caressing charm of a nice kitten, and now that the
      pressing matter of her indebtedness to Lester Kent was settled, she
      relapsed into her usual tranquil, happy-go-lucky self. She rubbed her
      cheek confidingly against Sara's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a pet angel, Sara, my own," she said. "I'm so glad you adopted
      us. Now I can go to the Herricks' tea-party this afternoon without having
      that twenty pounds nagging at the back of my mind all the time. I suppose"&mdash;glancing
      at the clock&mdash;"it's time we put on our glad rags. The Lavender Lady
      said she expected us at four."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later, Molly reappeared, looking quite impossibly lovely in a
      frock of the cheapest kind of material, "run up" by the local dressmaker,
      and very evidently with no other thought "at the back of her mind" than of
      the afternoon's entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-party was a small one, commensurate with the size of the rooms at
      Rose Cottage, and included only Sara and Molly, Mrs. Maynard, and, to
      Sara's surprise, Garth Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered the room, he turned quietly from the window where he had
      been standing looking out at the Herricks' charming garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Trent"&mdash;Miss Lavinia fluttered forward&mdash;"let me introduce
      you to Miss Tennant."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lavender Lady's pretty, faded blue eyes beamed benevolently on him.
      She was so <i>very</i> glad that "that poor, lonely fellow at Far End" had
      at last been induced to desert the solitary fastnesses of Monk's Cliff,
      but as she was simply terrified at the prospect of entertaining him
      herself&mdash;and Audrey Maynard seemed already fully occupied, chatting
      with Miles&mdash;she was only too thankful to turn him across to Sara's
      competent hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've met before, Miss Lavinia," said Trent, and over her head his hazel
      eyes met Sara's with a gamin amusement dancing in them. "Miss Tennant
      kindly called on me at Far End."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I didn't know." Little Miss Lavinia gazed in a puzzled fashion from
      one to the other of her guests. "Sara, my dear, you never told me that you
      and Dr. Selwyn had called on Mr. Trent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lavender Lady&mdash;we didn't. Neither of us would have dared to
      insult Mr. Trent by doing anything so conventional." The black eyes
      flashed back defiance at the hazel ones. "I got caught in a storm on the
      Monk's Cliff, and Mr. Trent&mdash;much against his will, I'm certain"&mdash;maliciously&mdash;"offered
      me shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that was kind of him. I'm sure Sara must have been most grateful to
      you." And the kind old face smiled up into Trent's dark, bitter one so
      simply and sincerely that it seemed as though, for the moment, some of the
      bitterness melted away. Not even so confirmed a misanthrope as the hermit
      of Far End could have entirely resisted the Lavender Lady, with her serene
      aroma of an old-world courtesy and grace long since departed from these
      hurrying twentieth-century days.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved away to the tea-table, leaving Trent and Sara standing together
      in the bay of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are overcoming your distaste for visiting," said Sara a little
      nervously. "I didn't expect to meet you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance held hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wished it," he answered gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden colour flamed up into the warm pallor of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you suggesting I invited you to meet me here?" she responded,
      willfully misinterpreting him. She shook her read regretfully. "You must
      have misunderstood me. I should never have imposed such a strain on your
      politeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes glinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," he said quietly, "that I should very much like to shake
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad," she answered heartily. "It's a devastating feeling! You made
      me feel just the same the day I travelled with you. So now we're quits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you&mdash;please&mdash;try to forget that day in the train?" he
      said quickly. "I behaved like a bore. I'm afraid I've no real excuse to
      offer, except that I'd been reminded of something that happened long ago&mdash;and
      I wanted to be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To enjoy the memory in solitude?" hazarded Sara flippantly. She was still
      nervous and talking rather at random, scarcely heeding what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of bitter irony crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly that," he said shortly, and Sara knew that somehow she had again
      inadvertently laid her hand upon an old hurt. She spoke with a sudden
      change of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, as the train doesn't hold pleasant memories for either of us, let's
      forget it," she suggested gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what that implies?" he asked. "It implies that you are
      willing to be friends. Do you mean that?"&mdash;incisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded silently, not trusting herself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said curtly, and then Audrey Maynard's gay voice broke
      across the tension of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Trent, I simply cannot allow Sara to monopolize you any longer. Now
      that we <i>have</i> succeeded in dragging the hermit out of his shell, we
      all want a share of his society, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent turned instantly, and Sara slipped across the room and took the
      place Audrey had vacated by Miles's couch. He greeted her coming with a
      smile, but there were shadows of fatigue beneath his eyes, and his lips
      were rather white and drawn-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a lazy way to receive visitors, isn't it?" he said
      apologetically. "But my game leg's given out to-day, so you must forgive
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's glance swept his face with quick sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You oughtn't to be at the 'party' at all," she said. "You look far too
      tired to be bothered with a parcel of chattering women."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," he whispered humorously, "that, although you're quite the
      four nicest women I know, the shameful truth is that I'm really here on
      behalf of the one man! I met him yesterday in the town and booked him for
      this afternoon, and, having at last dislodged him from his lone pinnacle,
      I hadn't the heart to leave him unsupported."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm glad you dug him out, Miles. It was clever of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will give Monkshaven something to talk about, anyway"&mdash;whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose"&mdash;the toe of Sara's narrow foot was busily tracing a
      pattern on the carpet&mdash;"I suppose you don't know why he shuts himself
      up like that at Far End?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," he answered. "But I'd wager it's for some better reason
      than people give him credit for. Or it may be merely a preference for his
      own society. Anyway, it is no business of ours." Then, swiftly softening
      the suggestion of reproof contained in his last sentence, he added: "Don't
      encourage me to gossip, Sara. When a man's tied by the leg, as I am, it's
      all he can do to curb a tendency towards tattling village scandal like
      some garrulous old woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the presence of visitors was inflicting a considerable
      strain on Herrick's endurance, and, as though by common consent, the
      little party broke up shortly after tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly expressed her intention of accompanying Mrs. Maynard back to
      Greenacres&mdash;the beautiful house which the latter had had built to her
      own design, overlooking the bay&mdash;in order to inspect the pretty
      widow's recent purchase of a new motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent turned to Sara with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it devolves on me to see you safely home, Miss Tennant, may I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded permission, and they set off through the high-hedged lane, Sara
      hurrying along at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes Trent strode beside her in silence. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you catching a train?" he inquired mildly. "Or is it only that you
      want to be rid of my company in the shortest possible time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She coloured, moderating her pace with an effort. Once again the odd
      nervousness engendered by his presence had descended on her. It was as
      though something in the man's dominating personality strung all her nerves
      to a high tension of consciousness, and she felt herself overwhelmingly
      sensible of his proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;if you're not in any hurry to get home&mdash;will you let me
      take you round by Crabtree Moor? It's part of a small farm of mine, and I
      want a word with my tenant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara acquiesced, and, Trent, having speedily transacted the little matter
      of business with his tenant, they made their way across a stretch of wild
      moorland which intersected the cultivated fields lying on either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk of the evening, with the wan light of the early moon deepening
      the shadows and transforming the clumps of furze into strange,
      unrecognizable shapes of darkness, it was an eerie enough place. Sara
      shivered a little, instinctively moving closer to her companion. And then,
      as they rounded a furze-crowned hummock, out of the hazy twilight, loping
      along on swift, padding feet, emerged the figure of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a muttered curse he swerved aside, but Trent's arm shot out, and,
      catching him by the shoulder, he swung him round so that he faced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leggo!" he muttered, twisting in Trent's iron grasp. "Leggo, can't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can, but I'm not going to," said Trent coolly. "At least, not till
      you've explained your presence here. This is private property. What are
      you doing on it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm doing no harm," growled the man sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?" Trent passed his free hand swiftly down the fellow's body, feeling
      the bulge of his coat. "Then what's the meaning of those rabbits sticking
      out under your coat? Now, look here, my man, I know you. You're Jim Brady,
      and it's not the first, nor the second, time I've caught you poaching on
      my land. But it's the last. Understand that? This time the Bench shall
      deal with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was silent for a moment. Then suddenly he burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, sir, pass it over this time. My missus is ill. She's mortal
      bad, God's truth she is, and haven't eaten nothing this three days past.
      An' I thought mebbe a bit o' stewed rabbit 'ud tempt 'er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" Trent was beginning contemptuously, when Sara leaned forward,
      peering into the poacher's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," she exclaimed. "It's Brady&mdash;Black Brady from Fallowdene."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ne'er-do-well as he was, the mere fact that he came from Fallowdene warmed
      her heart towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss, that's so," he answered readily. "And you're the young lady
      what used to live at Barrow Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know this man?" Trent asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bout as well as you do, sir," volunteered Brady with an impudent grin.
      "Catched me poachin' one morning. Fired me gun at 'er, too, I did, to
      frighten 'er," he continued reminiscently. "And she never blinked. You're
      a good-plucked 'un, miss,"&mdash;with frank admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked at the man doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know you lived here," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my native village, miss, Monks'aven is. But I didn't think 'twas too
      'healthy for me down here, back along"&mdash;grinning&mdash;"so I shifted
      to Fallowdene, where me grandmother lives. I came back here to marry
      Bessie Windrake' she've stuck to me like a straight 'un. But I didn't mean
      to get collared poachin' again. Me and Bess was goin' to live respectable.
      'Twas her bein' ill and me out of work w'at did it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him go," said Sara, appealing to Trent. But he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do that," he answered with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not 'im, miss, 'e won't," broke in Brady. "'E's not the soft-'earted
      kind, isn't Mr. Trent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent's brows drew together ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't mend matters by impudence, Brady," he said sharply. "Get along
      now"&mdash;releasing his hold of the man's arm&mdash;"but you'll hear of
      this again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Brady shot away into the darkness like an arrow, probably chortling to
      himself that his captor had omitted to relieve him of the brace of rabbits
      he had poached; and Sara, turning again to Trent, renewed her plea for
      clemency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Trent remained adamant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't he stand his punishment like any other man?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it's true that his wife is ill, and that he has been out of work&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you offering those facts as an excuse for dishonesty?" asked Trent
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe I am," she acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like nine-tenths of your sex, you are fiercely Tory in theory and a rank
      socialist in practice," he grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm not sure that that isn't a very good working basis to go on,"
      she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood in the porch at Sunnyside, she made yet one more effort to
      smooth matters over for the evil-doer, but Trent's face still showed
      unrelenting in the light that streamed out through the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me something else," he said. "I would do anything to please you,
      Sara, except"&mdash;with a sudden tense decision&mdash;"except interfere
      with the course of justice. Let every man pay the penalty for his own
      sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a hard creed," objected Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard?" He shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps it is. But"&mdash;grimly&mdash;"it's
      the only creed I believe in. Good-night"&mdash;he held out his hand
      abruptly. "I'm sorry I can't do as you ask about Jim Brady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Sara could reply, he was striding away down the path, and a minute
      later the darkness had hidden him from view.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TWO ON AN ISLAND
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara's conviction that Garth Trent would not be easily turned from any
      decision that he might take had been confirmed very emphatically over the
      matter of Black Brady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the fact that the man's story of his wife's illness proved
      to be perfectly genuine, Trent persisted that he must take his punishment,
      and all that Sara could do by way of mitigation was to promise Brady that
      she would pay the amount of any fine which might be imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brady, however, was not optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be no opshun of a fine, miss," he told her. "I've a-been up
      before the gen'lemen too many times"&mdash;grinning. "But if so be you'd
      give an eye to Bessie here, whiles I'm in quod, I'd take it very kind of
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His forecast summed up the situation with lamentable accuracy. No option
      of a fine was given, and during the brief space that the prison doors
      closed upon him, Sara saw to the welfare of his invalid wife, thereby
      winning the undying devotion of Black Brady's curiously composite soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he again found himself at liberty, she induced the frankly unwilling
      proprietor of the Cliff Hotel&mdash;the only hotel of any pretension to
      which Monkshaven could lay claim&mdash;to take him into his employment as
      an odd-job man. How she accomplished this feat it is impossible to say,
      but the fact remains that she did accomplish it, and perhaps Jane Crab
      delved to the root of the matter in the terse comment which the
      circumstances elicited from her: "Miss Tennant has a way with her that 'ud
      make they stone sphinxes gallop round the desert if so be she'd a mind
      they should."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, however, the sphinx of Far End was compounded of even more
      adamantine substance than his feminine prototype, for he exhibited a
      mulish aversion to budging an inch&mdash;much less galloping&mdash;in the
      direction Sara had indicated as desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two quarreled vehemently over the matter, and a glacial atmosphere of
      hostility prevailed between them during the period of Black Brady's
      incarceration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth, undeniably the victor, was the first to open peace negotiations,
      and a few days subsequent to Brady's release from prison, he waylaid Sara
      in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was preoccupied with numerous small, unnecessary commissions to be
      executed for Mrs. Selwyn at half-a-dozen different shops, and she would
      have passed him by with a frosty little bow had he not halted in front of
      her and deliberately held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning!" he said, blithely disregarding the coolness of his
      reception. "Am I still in disgrace? Brady's been restored to the bosom of
      his family for at least five days now, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead, the sun was shining gloriously in an azure sky flecked with
      little bunchy white clouds like floating pieces of cotton-wool, while an
      April breeze, fragrant of budding leaf and blossom, rollicked up the
      street. It seemed almost as though the frolicsome atmosphere of spring had
      permeated even the shell of the hermit and got into his system, for there
      was something incorrigibly boyish and youthful about him this morning. His
      cheerful smile was infectious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I be restored, too?" he asked
    </p>
    <p>
      "Restored to what?" asked Sara, trying to resist the contagion of his good
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well"&mdash;a faint shadow dimmed the sparkle in his eyes&mdash;"to
      the same old place I held before our squabble over Brady&mdash;just
      friends, Sara."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she hesitated. He had pitted his will against hers and won,
      hands down, and she felt distinctly resentful. But she knew that in a
      strange, unforeseen way their quarrel had hurt her inexplicably. She had
      hated meeting the cool, aloof expression of his eyes, and now, urged by
      some emotion of which she was, as yet, only dimly conscious, she
      capitulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good," he said contentedly. "And you might just as well give in
      now as later," he added, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," she protested, "you're a bully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I am&mdash;I glory in it! But now, just to show that you really do
      mean to be friends again, will you let me row you across to Devil's Hood
      Island this afternoon? You told me once that you wanted to go there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara considered the proposition for a moment, then nodded consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll come," she said, "I should like to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Devil's Hood Island was a chip off the mainland which had managed to keep
      its head above water when the gradually encroaching sea had stolen yet
      another mile from the coast. Sandy dunes, patched here and there with
      clumps of coarse, straggling rushes, sloped upward from the rock-strewn
      shore to a big crag that crowned its further side&mdash;a curious natural
      formation which had given the island its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shaped like a great overhanging hood, out of which, crudely
      suggested by the configuration of the rock, peered a diabolical face,
      weather-worn to the smoothness of polished marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      April was still doing her best to please, with blue skies and soft
      fragrant airs, when Garth gave a final push-off to the <i>Betsy Anne</i>,
      and bent to his oars as she skimmed out over the top of the waves with her
      nose towards Devil's Hood Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, comfortably ensconced amid a nest of cushions in the stern of the
      boat, pointed to a square-shaped basket of quite considerable dimensions,
      tucked away beneath one of the seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" she asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent's eyes followed the direction of her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That? Oh, that's our tea. You didn't imagine I was going to starve you,
      did you? I think we shall find that Mrs. Judson has provided all we want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed across at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a thoughtful man you are!" she said gaily. "Fancy a hermit
      remembering a woman's crucial need of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't credit me with too much self-effacement!" he grinned. "I enjoyed
      the last occasion when you were my guest, so I'm repeating the
      prescription."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, even deducting for the selfish motive, you're progressing," she
      answered. "I see you developing into quite an ornament to society in
      course of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid!" he ejaculated piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently your ambitions don't lie in that direction?" she rallied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no question of such a catastrophe occurring. I've told you that
      society&mdash;as such&mdash;and I have finished with each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded over, and for a while he sculled in silence, driving the
      <i>Betsy Anne</i> through the blue water with strong, steady strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was vividly conscious of the suggestion of supple strength conveyed
      by the rippling play of muscle beneath the white skin of his arms, bared
      to the elbow, and by the pliant swing of his body to each sure, rhythmical
      stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recollected that one of her earliest impressions concerning him had
      been of the sheer force of the man&mdash;the lithe, flexible strength like
      that of tempered steel&mdash;and she wondered whether this were entirely
      due to his magnificent physique or owed its impulse, in part, to some
      mental quality in him. Her eyes travelled reflectively to the lean,
      square-jawed face, with its sensitive, bitter-looking mouth and its fine
      modeling of brow and temple, as though seeking there the answer to her
      questionings, and with a sudden, intuitive instinct of reliance, she felt
      that behind all his cynicism and surface hardness, there lay a quiet, sure
      strength of soul that would not fail whoever trusted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he always spoke as though in some way his life had been a failure&mdash;as
      though he had met, and been defeated, by a shrewd blow of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara found it difficult to associate the words failure and defeat with her
      knowledge of his dominating personality and force of will, and the natural
      curiosity which had been aroused in her mind by his strange mode of life,
      with its deliberate isolation, and by the aroma of mystery which seemed to
      cling about him, deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brows drew together in a puzzled frown, as she inwardly sought for
      some explanation of the many inconsistencies she had encountered even in
      the short time that she had known him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His abrupt alterations from reticence to unreserved; his avowed dislike of
      women and the contradictory enjoyment which he seemed to find in her
      society; his love of music and of beautiful surroundings&mdash;alike
      indicative of a cultivated appreciation and experience of the good things
      of this world&mdash;and the solitary, hermit-like existence which he yet
      chose to lead&mdash;all these incongruities of temperament and habit wove
      themselves into an enigma which she found impossible to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth's voice recalled her abruptly from her musings to find that the <i>Betsy
      Anne</i> was swaying gently alongside a little wooden landing-stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how civilized!" she exclaimed. "One does not expect to find a jetty
      on a desert-island."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent laughed grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil's Hood is far from being a desert island in the summer, when the
      tourists come this way. They swarm over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was speaking, he had made fast the painter, and he now stepped
      out on to the landing-stage. Sara prepared to follow him. For a moment she
      stood poised with one foot on the gunwale of the boat, then, as an
      incoming wave drove the little skiff suddenly against the wooden supports
      of the jetty, she staggered, lost her balance, and toppled helplessly
      backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as she fell, Garth's arms closed round her like steel bars, and
      she felt herself lifted clean up from the rocking boat on to the
      landing-stage. For an instant she knew that she rested a dead weight
      against his breast; then he placed her very gently on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right?" he queried, steadying her with his hand beneath her arm.
      "That was a near shave."
    </p>
    <p>
      His queer hazel eyes were curiously bright, and Sara, meeting their gaze,
      felt her face flame scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, thanks," she said a little breathlessly, adding: "You must be very
      strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved her arm as though trying to free it from his clasp, and he
      released it instantly. But his face was rather white as he knelt down to
      lift out the tea-basket, and he, too, was breathing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat silently they made their way up the sandy slope that stretched
      ahead of them, and presently, as they mounted the last rise, the
      malignant, distorted face beneath the Devil's Hood leaped into view,
      granite-grey and menacing against the young blue of the April sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a perfectly horrible head!" exclaimed Sara, gazing at it aghast.
      "It's like a nightmare of some kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's not pretty," admitted Garth. "The mouth has a sort of
      malevolent leer, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has, indeed. One can hardly believe that it is just a natural
      formation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's always a hotly debated point whether the devil and his hood are
      purely the work of nature or not. My own impression is that to a certain
      extent they are, but that someone&mdash;centuries ago&mdash;being struck
      by the resemblance of the rock to a human face, added a few touches to
      complete the picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, whoever did it must have had a bizarre imagination to perpetuate
      such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The handiwork&mdash;if handiwork it is&mdash;is attributed to Friar
      Anselmo&mdash;the Spanish monk who broke his vows and escaped to
      Monkshaven, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't know," she said. "Tell me about him. He sounds quite
      exciting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't meant to say no one has enlightened you as to the gentleman
      whose exploit gave the town its name of Monkshaven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm afraid my education as far as local history is concerned has been
      shamefully neglected. Do make good the deficiencies"&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I will. I always have a kind of fellow-feeling for Friar
      Anselmo. But I propose we investigate the tea-basket first."
    </p>
    <p>
      They established themselves beneath the shelter of a big boulder, Garth
      first spreading a rug which he had brought from the boat for Sara to sit
      on. Then he unstrapped the tea-basket, and it became evident either that
      Mrs. Judson had a genius for assembling together the most fascinating
      little cakes and savoury sandwiches, accompanied by fragrant tea, hot from
      a thermos flask, or else that she had acted under instructions from some
      one to whom the cult of afternoon tea as sublimated by Rumpelmayer was not
      an unknown quantity. Sara, sipping her tea luxuriously, decided in favour
      of the latter explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a confirmed misogynist," she observed later on, when, the feast over,
      he was repacking the basket, "you have a very complete understanding of a
      woman's weakness for tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a case of cause and effect. A misogynist"&mdash;caustically&mdash;"is
      the product of a very complete understanding of most feminine weaknesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's slender figure tautened a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think," she said, speaking a little indignantly, "that it is quite
      nice of you to invite me out to a picnic and then to launch remarks of
      that description at my head?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," he acknowledged bluntly. "It's making you pay some one
      else's bill." His lean brown hand closed suddenly over hers. "Forgive me,
      Sara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt intensity of his manner was out of all proportion to the merely
      surface friction of the moment; and Sara, sensing something deeper and of
      more significance behind it, hurriedly switched the conversation into a
      less personal channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she said lightly, disengaging her hand. "I'll forgive you,
      and you shall tell me about Friar Anselmo." She lifted her eyes to the
      leering, sinister face that protruded from the Devil's Hood. "As,
      presumably, from his choice of a profession, he, too, had no love for
      women, you ought to enjoy telling his story," she added maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth's eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, it was love o' women that was Anselmo's undoing," he
      said. "In spite of his vows, he fell in love&mdash;with a very beautiful
      Spanish lady, and to make matters worse, if that were possible, the lady
      was possessed of a typically jealous Spanish husband, who, on discovering
      how the land lay, killed his wife, and would have killed Anselmo as well,
      but that he escaped to England. The vessel on which he sailed was wrecked
      at the foot of what has been called, ever since, the Monk's Cliff; but
      Anselmo himself succeeded in swimming ashore, and spent the remainder of
      his life at Monkshaven, doing penance for the mistakes of his earlier
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He chose a charming place to repent in," said Sara, her eyes wandering to
      the distant bay, where the quaint little town straggled picturesquely up
      the hill that sloped away from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," responded Garth slowly, "it's not a bad place&mdash;to repent in. .
      . . It would be a better place still&mdash;to love and be happy in."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brooding melancholy in his tones, and Sara, hearing it, spoke
      very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will find it&mdash;like that," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" He laughed hardly. "No! Those gifts of the gods are not for such as
      I. The husks are my portion. If it were not so"&mdash;his voice deepened
      to a sudden urgent note that moved her strangely&mdash;"if it were not so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      As though in spite of himself, his arms moved gropingly towards her. Then,
      with a muttered exclamation, he turned away and sprang hastily to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go back," he said abruptly, and Sara, shaken by his vehemence,
      rose obediently, and they began to retrace their steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had grown much colder. The sun hung low in the horizon, and the
      deceptive warmth of mid-afternoon had given place to the chill dampness in
      the atmosphere. Half unconsciously, feeling that the time must have
      slipped away more rapidly than she had suspected, Sara quickened her
      steps, Garth striding silently at her side. Presently the little wooden
      jetty came into view once more. It bore a curiously bare, deserted aspect,
      the waves riding and falling sluggishly on either side of its black,
      tarred planking, Sara stared at it incredulously, then an exclamation of
      sheer dismay burst from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boat! Look! It's gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Gone?</i>" Garth's eyes sought the landing-stage, then swept the vista
      of grey-water ahead of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Damn!</i>" he ejaculated forcibly. "She's got adrift!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A brown speck, bobbing maddeningly up and down in the distance and
      momentarily drifting further and further out to sea on the ebbing tide,
      was all that could be seen of the <i>Betsy Anne</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An involuntary chuckle broke from Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marooned!" she exclaimed. "How amusing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amusing?" Trent looked at her with a concerned expression. "It might be,
      if it were eleven o'clock in the morning. But it's the wrong end of the
      day. It will be dark before long." He paused, then asked swiftly: "Does
      any one at Sunnyside know where you are this afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The doctor and Molly were both out to lunch&mdash;and you know we
      only planned this trip this morning. I haven't seen them since. Why do you
      ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, if they know, they'd send over in search of us if we didn't turn
      up in the course of the next hour or so. But if they don't know where you
      are, we stand an excellent chance of spending the night here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of what had first struck her as merely an amusing <i>contretemps</i>
      suddenly presented itself to Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!&mdash;!" She drew her breath in sharply. "What&mdash;what on earth
      shall we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do?" Garth spoke with grim force. "Why, you must be got off the island
      somehow. If not, you're fair game for every venomous tongue in the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would any one hear us from the shore if we shouted?" she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The sound would carry in the opposite direction to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what <i>can</i> we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the manifest anxiety in Trent's face was reflected in her
      own. The possibility that they might be compelled to spend the night on
      Devil's Hood Island was not one that could be contemplated with
      equanimity, for Sara had no illusions whatever as to the charitableness of
      the view the world at large would take of such an episode&mdash;however
      accidental its occurrence. Unfortunately, essential innocence is
      frequently but a poor tool wherewith to scotch a scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one thing to be done," said Garth at last, after
      fruitlessly scanning the waters for any stray fishing-boat that might be
      passing. "I must swim across, and then row back and take you off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swim across?" Sara regarded the distance between the island and the shore
      with consternation. "You couldn't possibly do it. It's too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just under a mile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you would have the tide against you," she urged. The current off the
      coast ran with dangerous rapidity between the mainland and the island, and
      more than one strong swimmer, as Sara knew, had lost his life struggling
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked across to the further shore again, and all at once it seemed
      impossible to let Garth make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! You can't go!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't be nervous at being alone here?" he asked doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Of course not! But&mdash;oh! Don't you see? It's madness to think of
      swimming across with the tide against you! You could never do it. You
      might get cramp&mdash;Oh! Anything might happen! You shan't go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his arm impetuously, her eyes dilating with the sudden terror
      that had laid hold of her. But he was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look there," he said, pointing to a faint haze thickening the atmosphere.
      "Do you see the mist coming up? Very soon it will be all over us, like a
      blanket, and there'd be no possibility of swimming across at all. I must
      go at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that only adds to the danger," she argued desperately. "The fog may
      come down sooner than you expect, and then you'd lose your bearings
      altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must risk that," he answered grimly. "Don't you realize that it's
      impossible&mdash;<i>impossible</i> for us to remain here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," she returned stubbornly. "It isn't worth such a frightful
      risk. Some one is sure to look for us eventually."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Eventually' might mean to-morrow morning"&mdash;drily&mdash;"and that
      would be just twelve hours too late. It's worth the risk fifty times
      over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not!"&mdash;passionately. "Do you suppose I care two straws for the
      gossip of a parcel of spiteful old women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at the moment, perhaps, but later you wouldn't be able to help it.
      What people think of you, what they say of you, can make all the
      difference between heaven and hell." He spoke heavily, as though his words
      were weighted with some deadening memory. "And do you think I could bear
      to feel that I&mdash;<i>I</i> had given people a handle for gossiping
      about you? I'd cut their tongues out first!" he added savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stripped off his coat, and, sitting down on a rock, began removing his
      boots, while Sara stood watching him in silence with big, sombre eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he stood up, bareheaded and barefooted. Below the lean, tanned
      face the column of his throat showed white as a woman's, while the thin
      silk of his vest revealed the powerful line of shoulder at its base. His
      keen eyes were gazing steadily across to the opposite shore, as though
      measuring the distance he must traverse, and as a chance shaft from the
      westering sun rested upon him, investing him momentarily in its radiance,
      there seemed something rather splendid about him&mdash;something very sure
      and steadfast and utterly without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp cry broke from Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth! Garth!"&mdash;his name sprang to her lips spontaneously. "You
      mustn't go! You mustn't go! . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled round, and at the sight of her white, strained face a sudden
      light leapt into his eyes&mdash;the light of a great incredulity with,
      back of it, an unutterable hope and longing. In two strides he was at her
      side, his hands gripping her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Sara?&mdash;God in heaven!"&mdash;the words came hurrying from him,
      hoarse and uneven&mdash;"I believe you care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he hesitated, seeming to hold himself in check, then he
      caught her in his arms, kissing her fiercely on eyes and lips and throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear! . . . Oh! My dear! . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the broken words stammered through his hurried breathing as
      she lay unresistingly in his arms; then she felt him put her from him,
      gently, decisively, and she stood alone, swaying slightly. A long
      shuddering sigh ran through her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She never knew whether the word really passed her lips or whether it was
      only the cry of her inmost being, so importunate, so urgent that it seemed
      to take on actual sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no answer. He was gone, and through the light veil of the
      encroaching mists she could see him shearing his way through the
      leaden-coloured sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained motionless, her eyes straining after him. He was swimming
      easily, with a powerful overhand stroke that carried him swiftly away from
      the shore. A little sigh of relaxed tension fluttered between her lips. At
      least, he was a magnificent swimmer&mdash;he had that much in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her glance spanned the channel to the further shore, and it seemed as
      though an interminable waste of water stretched between. And all the time,
      at every stroke, that mad, racing current was pulling against him,
      fighting for possession of the strong, sinewy body battling against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She beat her hands together in an agony of fear. Why had she let him go?
      What did it matter if people talked&mdash;what was a tarnished reputation
      to set against a man's life? Oh! She had been mad to let him go!
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog grew denser. Strain as she might, she could no longer see the dark
      head above the water, the rise and fall of his arm like a white flail in
      the murky light, and she realized that should exhaustion overtake him, or
      the swift-running current beat him, drawing him under&mdash;she would not
      even know?
    </p>
    <p>
      A sickening sense of bitter impotence assailed her. There was nothing she
      could do but wait&mdash;wait helplessly until either his return, or
      endless hours of solitude, told her whether he had won or lost the fight
      against that grey, hungry waste of water. A strangled sob burst from her
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God! Let him come back to me! Let him come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The creak of straining rowlocks and the even plash of dripping oars,
      muffled by the numbing curtain of the fog, broke through the silence. Then
      followed the gentle thudding noise of a boat as it bumped against the
      jetty and a voice&mdash;Garth's voice&mdash;calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the ground where she had flung herself and came to him,
      peering at him with eyes that looked like two dark stains in the whiteness
      of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I though you were dead," she said dully. "Drowned. I mean&mdash;oh, of
      course, it's the same thing, isn't it?" And she laughed, the shrill,
      choking laughter of overwrought nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth observed her narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I've very much alive, thanks," he said, speaking in deliberately
      cheerful and commonplace accents. "But you look half frozen. Why on earth
      didn't you put the rug round you? Get into the boat and let me tuck you
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed passively, and in a few minutes they were slipping over the
      water as rapidly as the mist permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was very silent throughout the return journey. For hours, for an
      eternity it seemed, she had been in the grip of a consuming terror,
      culminating at last in the conviction that Garth had failed to make the
      further shore. And now, with the knowledge of his safety, the reaction
      from the tension of acute anxiety left her utterly flaccid and exhausted,
      incapable of anything more than a half-stunned acceptance of the miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the Selwyns' house was reached, it was with a manifest effort
      that she roused herself sufficiently to answer Garth's quiet apology for
      the misadventure of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it was your fault that we got stranded on the island," she said,
      summoning up rather a wan smile, "it is, at all events, thanks to you that
      I shall be sleeping under a respectable roof, instead of scandalizing half
      the neighbourhood!" She paused, then went on uncertainly: "'Thank you'
      seems ludicrously inadequate for all you've done&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done nothing," he interrupted brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You risked your life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      An impatient exclamation broke from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I did? I risked something of no value, I assure you&mdash;to
      myself, or any one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he added practically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get Jane Crab to give you some hot soup and go to bed. You look
      absolutely done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded, smiling more naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," she said. "Good-night, then." She held out her hand a little
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it, holding it closely in his, and looking down at her with the
      strange expression of a man who strives to impress upon his mind the
      picture of a face he may not see again, so that in a lonely future he
      shall find comfort in remembering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye!" he said, at last, very gravely. Then a queer little smile,
      half-bitter, half-tender, curving his lips, he added: "I shall always have
      this one day for which to thank whatever gods there be."

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A REVOKE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara lay long awake that night. Under Jane Crab's bluff and kindly
      ministrations, her feeling of utter bodily exhaustion had given place to
      an exquisite sense of mental and physical well-being, and, freed from the
      shackles of material discomfort, her thoughts flew backward over the
      events of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All <i>was</i> well&mdash;gloriously, blessedly well! There could be no
      misunderstanding that brief, passionate moment when Garth had held her in
      his arms; and the blinding anguish of those hours which had followed, when
      she had not known whether he were alive or dead, had shown her her own
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love had come to her&mdash;the love which Patrick Lovell had called the
      one altogether good and perfect gift&mdash;and with it came a tremulous
      unrest, a shy sweetness of desire that crept through all her veins like
      the burning of a swift flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt no fear or shame of love. Sara would never be afraid of life and
      its demands, and it seemed to her a matter of little moment that Garth had
      made no conventional avowal of his love. She did not, on that account,
      pretend, even to herself, as many women would have done, that her own
      heart was untouched, but recognized and accepted the fact that love had
      come to her with absolute simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did she doubt or question Garth's feeling for her. She <i>knew</i>, in
      every fibre of her being, that he loved her, and she was ready to wait
      quite patiently and happily the few hours that must elapse before he could
      come to her and tell her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she longed, with a woman's natural longing, to hear him say in actual
      words all that his whole attitude towards her had implied, craved for the
      moment when the beloved voice should ask for that surrender which in
      spirit she had already made.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose early, with a ridiculous feeling that it would bring the time a
      little nearer, and Jane Crab stared in amazement when she appeared
      downstairs while yet the preparations for breakfast were hardly in
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're no worse for your outing, then, Miss Tennant," she observed,
      adding shrewdly: "I'd as lief think you were the better for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed, flushing a little. Somehow she did not mind the humorous
      suspicion of the truth that twinkled in Jane's small, boot-button eyes,
      but she sincerely hoped that the rest of the household would not prove
      equally discerning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She need have had no fears on that score. Dr. Selwyn had barely time to
      swallow a cup of coffee and a slice of toast before rushing off in
      response to an urgent summons from a patient, whilst Molly seemed entirely
      preoccupied with the contents of a letter, in an unmistakably masculine
      handwriting, which had come for her by the morning's post. As for Mrs.
      Selwyn, she was always too much engrossed in analyzing the symptoms of
      some fresh ailment she believed she had acquired to be sensible of the
      emotional atmosphere of those around her. Her own sensations&mdash;whether
      she were too hot, or not quite hot enough, whether her new tabloids were
      suiting her or whether she had not slept as well as usual&mdash;occupied
      her entire horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning she was distressed because the hairpins Sara had purchased
      for her the previous day differed slightly in shape from those she was in
      the habit of using.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara explained that they were the only ones obtainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Bloxham's, you mean, dear. Oh, well, of course, you couldn't get any
      others, then. Perhaps if you had tried another shop&mdash;" Mrs. Selwyn
      paused, to let this suggestion sink in, then added brightly: "But,
      naturally, I couldn't expect you to spend your whole morning going from
      shop to shop looking for my particular kind of hairpin, could I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, who had expended a solid hour over that very occupation, was
      perfectly conscious of the reproach implied. She ignored it, however. Like
      every one else in close contact with Mrs. Selwyn, she had learned to
      accept the fact that the poor lady seriously believed that her whole life
      was spent in bearing with admirable patience the total absence of
      consideration accorded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she descended from Mrs. Selwyn's room Sara was amazed to find that
      the hands of the clock only indicated half-past ten. Surely no morning had
      ever dragged itself away so slowly!
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o'clock she and Molly were both due to lunch with Mrs. Maynard at
      Greenacres, and she was radiantly aware that Garth Trent would be included
      among the guests. Between them, Audrey, and the Herricks, and Sara had
      succeeded in enticing the hermit within the charmed circle of their
      friendship, and he could now be depended upon to join their little
      gatherings&mdash;"provided," as he had bluntly told Audrey, "that you can
      put up with my manners and morals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard had only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not in the least likely to find fault with your manners," she said
      cheerfully. "They're really quite normal, and as for your morals, they are
      your own affair, my dear man. Anyway, there is at least one bond between
      us&mdash;Monkshaven heartily disapproves of both of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenacres was a delightful place, built rather on the lines of a French
      country house, with the sitting-rooms leading one into the other and each
      opening in its turn on to a broad wooden verandah. The latter ran round
      three sides of the house, and in summer the delicate pink of Dorothy
      Perkins fought for supremacy with the deeper red of the Crimson Rambler,
      converting it into a literal bower of roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey was on the steps to greet the two girls when they arrived, looking,
      as usual, as though she had just quitted the hands of an expert French
      maid. It was in a great measure to the ultra-perfection of her toilette
      that she owed the critical attitude accorded her by the feminine half of
      Monkshaven. To the provincial mind, the fact that she dyed her hair,
      ordered her frocks from Paris, and kept a French chef to cook her food,
      were all so many indications of an altogether worldly and abandoned
      character&mdash;and of a wealth that was secretly to be envied&mdash;and
      the more venomous among Audrey's detractors lived in the perennial hope of
      some day unveiling the scandal which they were convinced lay hidden in her
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey was perfectly aware of the gossip of which she was the subject&mdash;and
      completely indifferent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It amuses them," she would say blithely, "and it doesn't hurt me in the
      least. If Mr. Trent and I both left the neighbourhood, Monkshaven would be
      at a loss for a topic of conversation&mdash;unless they decided, as they
      probably would, that we had eloped together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself was quite above the petty meanness of envying another woman's
      looks or clothes, and she beamed frank admiration over Molly's appearance
      as she led the way into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly, you're too beautiful to be true," she declared, pausing in the
      hall to inspect the girl's young loveliness in its setting of shady hat
      and embroidered muslin frock. Big golden poppies on the hat, and a girdle
      at her waist of the same tawny hue, emphasized the rare colour of her eyes&mdash;in
      shadow, brown like an autumn leaf, gold like amber when the sunlight lay
      in them&mdash;and the whole effect was deliciously arresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been spending your substance in riotous purple and fine linen,"
      pursued Audrey relentlessly. "That frock was never evolved in Oldhampton,
      I'm positive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly blushed&mdash;not the dull, unbecoming red most women achieve, but a
      delicate pink like the inside of a shell that made her look even more
      irresistibly distracting than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she admitted reluctantly, "I sent for this from town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara glanced at her with quick surprise. Entirely absorbed in her own
      thoughts, she had failed to observe the expensive charm of Molly's
      toilette and now regarded it attentively. Where had she obtained the money
      to pay for it? Only a very little while ago she had been in debt, and now
      here she was launching out into expenditure which common sense would
      suggest must be quite beyond her means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara frowned a little, but, recognizing the impossibility of probing into
      the matter at the moment, she dismissed it from her mind, resolving to
      elucidate the mystery later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, it was impossible to do other than acknowledge the results
      obtained. Molly looked more like a stately young empress than an
      impecunious doctor's daughter as she floated into the room, to be embraced
      and complimented by the Lavender Lady and to receive a generous meed of
      admiration, seasoned with a little gentle banter, from Miles Herrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara experienced a sensation of relief on discovering Miss Lavinia and
      Herrick to be the only occupants of the room. Garth Trent had not yet
      come. Despite her longing to see him again, she was conscious of a certain
      diffidence, a reluctance at meeting him in the presence of others, and she
      wished fervently that their first meeting after the events of the previous
      day could have taken place anywhere rather than at this gay little lunch
      party of Audrey's.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it fell out, however, she chanced to be entirely alone in the room when
      Trent was at length ushered in by a trim maidservant, the rest of the
      party having gradually drifted out on to the verandah, while she had
      lingered behind, glad of a moment's solitude in which to try and steady
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never conceived it possible that so commonplace an emotion as mere
      nervousness could find place beside the immensities of love itself, yet,
      during the interminable moment when Garth crossed the room to her side,
      she was supremely aware of an absurd desire to turn and flee, and it was
      only by a sheer effort of will that she held her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he had shaken hands with her and was making some tranquil
      observation upon the lateness of his arrival. His manner was quite
      detached, every vestige of anything beyond mere conventional politeness
      banished from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coolly neutral inflections of his voice struck upon Sara's keyed-up
      consciousness as an indifferent finger may twang the stretched strings of
      a violin, producing a shuddering violation of their harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly knew how she answered him. She only knew, with a sudden
      overwhelming certainty, that the Garth who stood beside her now was a
      different man, altered out of all kinship with the man who had held her in
      his arms on Devil's Hood Island. The lover was gone; only the acquaintance
      remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stammered a few halting words by way of response, and&mdash;was she
      mistaken, or did a sudden look of understanding, almost, it seemed, of
      compunction, leap for a moment into his eyes, only to be replaced by the
      brooding, bitter indifference habitual to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportune return of Audrey and her other guests, heralded by a gust of
      cheerful laughter, tided over the difficult moment, and Garth turned away
      to make his apologies to his hostess, blaming some slight mishap to his
      car for the tardiness of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout lunch Sara conversed mechanically, responding like an automaton
      when any one put a penny in the slot by asking her a question. She felt
      utterly bewildered, stunned by Garth's behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had their meeting been exchanged under the observant eyes of the rest of
      the party, it would have been intelligible to her, for he was the last man
      in the world to wear his heart upon his sleeve. But they had been quite
      alone for the moment, and yet he had permitted no acknowledgment of the
      new relations between them to appear either in word or look. He had
      greeted her precisely as though they were no more to each other than the
      merest acquaintances&mdash;as though the happenings of the previous day
      had been wiped out of his mind. It was incomprehensible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara felt almost as if some one had dealt her a physical blow, and it
      required all her pluck and poise to enable her to take her share of the
      general conversation before wending their several ways homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . And we'll picnic on Devil's Hood Island."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey's high, clear voice, as she chattered to Molly, characteristically
      propounding half-a-dozen plans for the immediate future, floated across to
      Sara where she stood waiting on the lowest step, impatient to be gone. As
      though drawn by some invisible magnet, her eyes encountered Garth's, and
      the swift colour rushed into her cheeks, staining them scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His expression was enigmatical. The next moment he bent forward and spoke,
      in a low voice that reached her ear alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much maligned place&mdash;where I tasted my one little bit of heaven!"
      Then, after a pause, he added deliberately: "But a black sheep has no
      business with heaven. He'd be turned away from the doors&mdash;and quite
      rightly, too! That's why I shall never ask for admittance." He regarded
      her steadily for a moment, then quietly averted his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sara realized that in those few words he had revoked&mdash;repudiating
      all that he had claimed, all that he had given, the day before.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DISILLUSION
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Letters are unsatisfactory things at the best of times, and what we all
      want is to have you with us again for a little while. I am sure you must
      have had a surfeit of the simple life by this time, so come to us and be
      luxurious and exotic in London for a change. Don't disappoint us, Sara!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours ever affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      "ELISABETH."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, seated at the open window of her room, re-read the last paragraph of
      the letter which the morning's post had brought her, and then let it fall
      again on to her lap, whilst she stared with sombre eyes across the bay to
      where the Monk's Cliff reared itself, stark and menacing, against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      April had slipped into May, and the blue waters of the Channel flickered
      with a myriad dancing points of light reflected from an unclouded sun. The
      trees had clothed themselves anew in pale young green, and the whole
      atmosphere was redolent of spring&mdash;spring as she reaches her maturity
      before she steps aside to let the summer in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara frowned a little. She was out of tune with the harmony of things. You
      need happiness in your heart to be at one with the eager pulsing of new
      life, the reaching out towards fulfillment that is the essential quality
      of spring. Whereas Sara's heart was empty of happiness and hopes, and of
      all the joyous beginnings that are the glorious appanage of youth. There
      could be no beginnings for her, because she had already reached the end&mdash;reached
      it with such a stupefying suddenness that for a time she had been hardly
      conscious of pain, but only of a fierce, intolerable resentment and of a
      pride&mdash;that "devil's own pride" which Patrick had told her was the
      Tennant heritage&mdash;which had been wounded to the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth had taken that pride of hers and ground it under his heel. He had
      played at love, and she had been fool enough to mistake love's simulacrum
      for the real thing. Or, if there had been any genuine spark of love
      kindling the fire of passion that had blazed about her for one brief
      moment, then he had since chosen deliberately to disavow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had indicated his intention unmistakably. Since the day of the luncheon
      party at Greenacres he had shunned meeting her whenever possible, and, on
      the one or two occasions when an encounter had been unavoidable, his
      manner had been frigidly indifferent and impersonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly she had repaid him in full measure&mdash;indifference for
      indifference, ice for ice, gallantly matching her woman's pride against
      his deliberate apathy, but inwardly she writhed at the remembrance of that
      day on the island, when, in the stress of her terror for his safety, she
      had let him see into the very heart of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was over now, and done with. The brief vision of love which had
      given a new, transcendent significance to the whole of life, had faded
      swiftly into bleak darkness, its memory marred by that bitterest of all
      knowledge to a woman&mdash;the knowledge that she had been willing to give
      her love, to make the great surrender, and that it had not been required
      of her. All that remained was to draw a veil as decently as might be over
      the forgettable humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain of the last fortnight had left its mark on her. The angles of
      her face seemed to have become more sharply defined, and her eyes were too
      brilliant and held a look of restlessness. But her lips closed as firmly
      as ever, a courageous scarlet line, denying the power of fate to thrust
      her under.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Book of Garth&mdash;the book of love&mdash;was closed, but there were
      many other volumes in life's library, and Sara did not propose to go
      through the probable remaining fifty or sixty years of her existence
      uselessly bewailing a dead past. She would face life, gamely, whatever it
      might bring, and as she had already sustained one of the hardest blows
      ever likely to befall her, she would probably make a success of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unquestionably, she would be glad to get away from Monkshaven for a
      time, to have leisure to readjust her outlook on life, free from the
      ceaseless reminders that the place held for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in Monkshaven, it seemed as though Garth's personality informed the
      very air she breathed. The great cliff where he had his dwelling frowned
      at her from across the bay whenever she looked out of her window, his name
      was constantly on the lips of those who made up her little circle of
      friends, and every day she was haunted by the fear of meeting him. Or,
      worse than all else, should that fear materialize, the torment of the
      almost hostile relationship which had replaced their former friendship had
      to be endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation to join the Durwards in London had come at an opportune
      moment, offering, as it did, a way of escape from the embarrassments
      inseparable from the situation. Moreover, amid the distractions and bustle
      of the great city it would be easier to forget for a little her burden of
      pain and humiliation. There is so much time for thinking&mdash;and for
      remembering&mdash;in the leisurely tranquillity of country life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara would have accepted the invitation without hesitation, but that there
      seemed to her certain reasons why her absence from Sunnyside just now was
      inadvisable&mdash;reasons based on her loyalty to Doctor Dick and the
      trust he had reposed in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last few weeks she had been perplexed and not a little worried
      concerning Molly's apparent accession to comparative wealth. Certain small
      extravagances in which the latter had recently indulged must have been,
      Sara knew, beyond the narrow limits of her purse, and inquiry had elicited
      from Selwyn the fact that she had received no addition to her usual
      allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly herself had light-heartedly evaded all efforts to gain her
      confidence, and Sara had refrained from putting any direct question,
      since, after all, she was not the girl's guardian, and her interference
      might very well be resented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was uneasily conscious that for some reason or other Molly was in a
      state of tension, alternating between abnormally high spirits and the
      depths of depression, and the recollection of that unpleasant little
      episode of her indebtedness to Lester Kent lingered disagreeably in Sara's
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen the man once, in Oldhampton High Street&mdash;Molly, at that
      time still clothed in penitence, had pointed him out to her&mdash;and she
      had received an unpleasing impression of a lean, hatchet face with
      deep-set, dense-brown eyes, and of a mouth like that of a bird of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt reluctant to go away and leave things altogether to chance, and
      finally, unable to come to any decision, she carried Elisabeth's letter
      down to Selwyn's study and explained the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded over at the prospect of her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall miss you abominably," he declared. "But of course"&mdash;ruefully&mdash;"I
      can quite understand Mrs. Durward's wanting you to go back to them for a
      time, and I suppose we must resign ourselves to being unselfish. Only you
      must promise to come back again&mdash;you mustn't desert us altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be afraid of that. I shall turn up again like the proverbial
      bad penny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, make it a promise," he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise, then, you distrustful man! But about Molly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you need worry about her." Selwyn laughed a little. "The
      sudden accession to wealth is accounted for. It seems that she has sold a
      picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! So that's the explanation, is it?" Sara felt unaccountably relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;though goodness knows how she has beguiled any one into buying
      one of her daubs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they're quite good, really, Doctor Dick. It's only that Futurist Art
      doesn't appeal to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly! She showed me one of her paintings the other day. It looked
      like a bad motor-bus accident in a crowded street, and she told me that it
      represented the physical atmosphere of a woman who had just been jilted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed suddenly and hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How&mdash;how awfully funny!" she said in an odd, choked voice. Then,
      fearful of losing her self-command, she added hastily: "I'll write and
      tell Elisabeth that I'll come, then." And fled out of the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ELISABETH INTERVENES
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Sara stepped out of the train at Paddington, the first person upon whom
      her eyes alighted was Tim Durward. He hastened up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim!" she exclaimed delightedly. "How dear of you to come and meet me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you expect I should?" He was holding her hand and joyfully
      pump-handling it up and down as though he would never let it go, while the
      glad light in his eyes would indubitably have betrayed him to any
      passer-by who had chanced to glance in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara coloured faintly and withdrew her hands from his eager clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, you might conceivably have had something else to do," she
      returned evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the blue eyes clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never had anything to do," he said shortly. "You know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Tim, I won't be growled at the first minute of my arrival. You can
      pour out your grumbles another day. First now, I want to hear all the
      news. Remember, I've been vegetating in the country since the beginning of
      March!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew him tactfully away from the old sore subject of his enforced
      idleness, and, while the car bore them swiftly towards the Durwards' house
      on Green Street, she entertained him with a description of the Selwyn
      trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think your 'Doctor Dick' considers himself damned lucky in
      having got you there&mdash;seeing that his house seems all at sixes and
      sevens," commented Tim rather glumly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does. Oh! I'm quite appreciated, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim made no reply, but stared out of the window. The car rounded the
      corner into Park Lane; in another moment they would reach their
      destination. Suddenly he turned to her, his face rather strained-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;the other man? Have you met him yet&mdash;at Monkshaven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking his meaning. Sara's eyes met his unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean has any one asked me to marry him&mdash;no, Tim. No one has
      done me that honour," she answered lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!" he muttered below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you&mdash;got over that, yet?" she said, hesitatingly. "I&mdash;I
      hoped you would, Tim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never get over it," he asserted doggedly. "And I shall never give
      you up till you are another man's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet intensity of his tones sounded strangely in her ears. This was a
      new Tim, not the boyish Tim of former times, but a man with all a man's
      steadfast purpose and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was spared the necessity of reply by the fact that they had reached
      their journey's end. The car slid smoothly to a standstill, and almost
      simultaneously the house-door opened, and behind the immaculate figure of
      the Durwards' butler Sara descried the welcoming faces of Geoffrey and
      Elisabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was good to see them both again&mdash;Geoffrey, big and debonair as
      ever, his jolly blue eyes beaming at her delightedly, and Elisabeth, still
      with that same elusive atmosphere of charm which always seemed to cling
      about her like the fragrance of a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were eager to hear Sara's news, plying her with questions, so that
      before the end of her first evening with them they had gleaned a fairly
      accurate description of her life at Sunnyside and of the new circle of
      friends she had acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one name she refrained from mentioning&mdash;that of Garth
      Trent, and none of Elisabeth's quietly uttered comments or inquiries
      sufficed to break through the guard of her reticence concerning the Hermit
      of Far End.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds rather a manless Eden&mdash;except for the nice, lame Herrick
      person," said Elisabeth at last, and her hyacinth eyes, with their
      curiously veiled expression, rested consideringly on Sara's face, alight
      with interest as she had vividly sketched the picture of her life at
      Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose it is rather," she admitted. Her tone was carelessly
      indifferent, but the eager light died suddenly out of her face, and
      Elisabeth, smiling faintly, adroitly turned the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara speedily discovered that she would have even less time for the
      fruitless occupation of remembering than she had anticipated. The Durwards
      owned a host of friends in town with whom they were immensely popular, and
      Sara found herself caught up in a perpetual whirl of entertainment that
      left her but little leisure for brooding over the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt sometimes as though the London season had opened and swallowed
      her up, as the whale swallowed Jonah, and when she declared herself
      breathless with so much rushing about, Tim would coolly throw over any
      engagement that chanced to have been made and carry her off for a day up
      the river, where a quiet little lunch, in the tranquil shade of
      overhanging trees, and the cosy, intimate talk that was its invariable
      concomitant, seemed like an oasis of familiar, homely pleasantness in the
      midst of the gay turmoil of London in May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim had developed amazingly. He seemed instinctively to recognize her
      moods, adapting himself accordingly, and in his thought and care for her
      there was a half-playful, half-tender element of possessiveness that
      sometimes brought a smile to her lips&mdash;and sometimes a sigh, as the
      inevitable comparison asserted itself between Tim's gentle ruling and the
      brusque, forceful mastery that had been Garth's. But, on the whole, the
      visit to the Durwards was productive of more smiles than sighs, and Sara
      found Tim's young, chivalrous devotion very soothing to the wound her
      pride had suffered at Garth's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She overflowed in gratitude to Elisabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're giving me a perfectly lovely time," she told her. "And Tim <i>is</i>
      such a good playfellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth's face seemed suddenly to glow with that inner radiance which
      praise of her beloved Tim alone was able to inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that, Sara?" she said very quietly. Yet somehow Sara knew that she
      meant to have an answer to her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;" she stammered a little. "Isn't that enough?"&mdash;trying
      to speak lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim wants more than a playfellow. Can't you give him what he wants,
      Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know he had told you," she said, at last, rather lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor has he. Tim is loyal to the core. But a mother doesn't need telling
      these things." Elisabeth's beautiful voice deepened. "Tim is bone of my
      bone and flesh of my flesh&mdash;and he's soul of my soul as well. Do you
      think, then, that I shouldn't know when he is hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was strangely moved. There was something impressive in the restrained
      passion of Elisabeth's speech, a certain primitive grandeur in her
      envisagement of the relationship of mother and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect," pursued Elisabeth calmly, "that you think I'm going too far&mdash;farther
      than I have any right to. But it's any mother's right to fight for her
      son's happiness, and I'm fighting for Tim's. Why won't you marry him,
      Sara?" The question flashed out suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;why&mdash;oh, because I'm not in love with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of rather sardonic mirth showed in Elisabeth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish," she observed, "that we lived in the good old days when you could
      have been carried off by sheer force and <i>compelled</i> to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really believe you mean it!" she said with some amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. I shouldn't have hesitated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about me? You wouldn't have considered my feelings at all in the
      matter, I suppose?" Sara was still smiling, yet she had a dim
      consciousness that, preposterous as it sounded, Elisabeth would have had
      no scruples whatever about putting such a plan into effect had it been in
      any way feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Elisabeth replied with the utmost composure. "Tim comes first. But"&mdash;and
      suddenly her voice melted to an indescribable sweetness&mdash;"You would
      be almost one with him in my heart, because you had brought him
      happiness." She paused, then launched her question with a delicate
      hesitancy that skillfully concealed all semblance of the probe. "Tell me&mdash;is
      there any one else who has asked of you what Tim asks? Perhaps I have come
      too late with my plea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said flatly, "there is no one else." With a sudden bitter
      self-mockery she added: "Tim's is the only proposal of marriage I have to
      my credit."
    </p>
    <p>
      The repressed anxiety with which Elisabeth had been regarding her relaxed,
      and a curious look of content took birth in the hyacinth eyes. It was as
      though the bitterness of Sara's answer in some way reassured her, serving
      her purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then can't you give Tim what he wants? You will be robbing no one. Sara"&mdash;her
      low voice vibrated with the urgency of her desire&mdash;"promise me at
      least that you will think it over&mdash;that you will not dismiss the idea
      as though it were impossible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara half rose; her eyes, wide and questioning, were fixed upon
      Elisabeth's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why&mdash;why do you ask me this?" she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I think"&mdash;very softly&mdash;"that Tim himself will ask you
      the same thing before very long. And I can't face what it will mean to him
      if you send him away. . . . You would be happy with him, Sara. No woman
      could live with Tim and not grow to love him&mdash;certainly no woman whom
      Tim loved."
    </p>
    <p>
      The depth of her conviction imbued her words with a strange force of
      suggestion. For the first time the idea of marriage with Tim presented
      itself to Sara as a remotely conceivable happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto she had looked upon his love for her as something which only
      touched the outer fringe of her life&mdash;a temporary disturbance of the
      good-comradely relations that had existed between them. With the easy
      optimism of a woman whose heart has always been her own exclusive property
      she had hoped he would "get over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Elisabeth's appeal, and the knowledge of the pain of love, which
      love itself had taught her, quickened her mind to a new understanding.
      Perhaps Elisabeth felt her yield to the impression she had been
      endeavoring to create, for she rose and came and stood quite close to her,
      looking down at her with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give my son his happiness!" she said. And the eternal supplication of all
      motherhood was in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara made no answer. She sat very still, with bent head. Presently there
      came the sound of light footsteps as Elisabeth crossed the room, and, a
      moment later, the door closed softly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thrust a new responsibility on Sara's shoulders&mdash;the
      responsibility of Tim's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give my son his happiness!" The poignant appeal of the words rang in
      Sara's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, why not? As Elisabeth had said, she would be robbing no one by
      so doing. The man for whom had been reserved the place in the sacred inner
      temple of her heart had signified very clearly that he had no intention of
      claiming it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No other would ever enter in his stead; the doors of that innermost
      sanctuary would be kept closed, shutting in only the dead ashes of
      remembrance. But if entrance to the outer courts of the temple meant so
      much to Tim, why should she not make him free of them? That other had come
      and gone again, having no need of her, while Tim's need was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life, at the moment stretched in front of her very vague and purposeless,
      and she knew that by marrying Tim she would make three people whom she
      loved, and who mattered most to her in the whole world&mdash;Tim, and
      Elisabeth, and Geoffrey&mdash;supremely happy. No one need suffer except
      herself&mdash;and for her there was no escape from suffering either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that when, as her visit drew towards its close, Tim came
      to her and asked her once again to be his wife, she gave him an answer
      which by no stretch of the imagination could she have conceived as
      possible a short three weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very frank with him. She was determined that if he married her, it
      must be open-eyed, recognizing that she could only give him honest liking
      in return for love. Upon a foundation of sincerity some mutual happiness
      might ultimately be established, but there should be no submerged rock of
      ignorance and misunderstanding on which their frail barque of matrimonial
      happiness might later founder in a sea of infinite regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you willing to take me&mdash;like that?" she asked him. "Knowing that
      I can only give you friendship? I wish&mdash;I wish I could give you what
      you ask&mdash;but I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim's eyes searched hers for a long moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there some one else?" he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of painful colour flooded her face, then ebbed away, leaving it
      curiously white and pinched-looking, but her eyes still met his bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is&mdash;no one who will ever want your place, Tim," she said with
      an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her evident distress hurt him intolerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me!" he exclaimed quickly. "I had no right to ask that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you had," she replied steadily, "since you have asked me to be your
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you've answered it&mdash;and it doesn't make a bit of difference. I
      want you. I'll take what you can give me, Sara. Perhaps, some day, you'll
      be able to give me love as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't count on that, Tim. Friendship, understanding, the comradeship
      which, after all, can mean a good deal between a man and woman&mdash;all
      these I can give you. And if you think those things are worth while, I'll
      marry you. But&mdash;I'm not in love with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be&mdash;I'm sure it's catching," he declared with the gay,
      buoyant confidence which was one of his most endearing qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it were," she said. "But please be serious, Tim dear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I be?" he interrupted joyfully. "When the woman I love tells me
      that she'll marry me, do you suppose I'm going to pull a long face about
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her in his arms and kissed her with all the impetuous fervour of
      his two-and-twenty years. At the touch of his warm young lips, her own
      lips whitened. For an instant, as she rested in his arms, she was stabbed
      through and through by the memory of those other arms that had held her as
      in a vice of steel, and of stormy, passionate kisses in comparison with
      Tim's impulsive caress, half-shy, half-reverent, seemed like clear water
      beside the glowing fire of red wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself sharply out of his embrace. Would she never forget&mdash;would
      she be for ever remembering, comparing? If so, God help her!
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said quietly. "You needn't pull a long face over it. But&mdash;but
      marriage is a serious thing, Tim, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear"&mdash;he spoke with a sudden gentle gravity&mdash;"don't
      misunderstand me. Marriage with you is the most serious and wonderful and
      glorious thing that could ever happen to a man. When you're my wife, I
      shall be thanking God on my knees every day of my life. All the jokes and
      nonsense are only so many little waves of happiness breaking on the shore.
      But behind them there is always the big sea of my love for you&mdash;the
      still waters, Sara."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara remained silent. The realization of the tender, chivalrous,
      worshiping love this boy was pouring out at her feet made her feel very
      humble&mdash;very ashamed and sorry that she could give so little in
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she turned and held out her hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim&mdash;my Tim," she said, and her voice shook a little. "I'll try not
      to disappoint you."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE NAME OF DURWARD
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Durwards received the news of their son's engagement to Sara with
      unfeigned delight. Geoffrey was bluffly gratified at the materialization
      of his private hopes, and Elisabeth had never appeared more captivating
      than during the few days that immediately followed. She went about as
      softly radiant and content as a pleased child, and even the strange,
      watchful reticence that dwelt habitually in her eyes was temporarily
      submerged by the shining happiness that welled up within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She urged that an early date should be fixed for the wedding, and Sara,
      with a dreary feeling that nothing really mattered very much, listlessly
      acquiesced. Driven by conflicting influences she had burned her boats, and
      the sooner all signs of the conflagration were obliterated the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she opposed a quiet negative to the further suggestion that she should
      accompany the Durwards to Barrow Court instead of returning to Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't do that," she said with decision. "I promised Doctor Dick I
      would go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth smiled airily. Apparently she had no scruples about the keeping
      of promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easily arranged," she affirmed. "I'll write to your precious
      doctor man and tell him that we can't spare you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as personal inclination was concerned, Sara would gladly have
      adopted Elisabeth's suggestion. She shrank inexpressibly from returning to
      Monkshaven, shrouded, as it was, in brief but poignant memories, but she
      had given Selwyn her word that she would go back, and, even in a
      comparatively unimportant matter such as this appeared, she had a
      predilection in favour of abiding by a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're putting Dr. Selwyn before us," she declared, candidly amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised him first," replied Sara. "In my position, you'd do the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't," she replied with energy. "The people I love come first&mdash;all
      the rest nowhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm glad I'm one of the people you love," retorted Sara, laughing.
      "And, let me tell you, I think you're a most unmoral person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth looked at her reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I am," she acknowledged. "At least, from a conventional point of
      view. Certainly I shouldn't let any so-called moral scruples spoil the
      happiness of any one I cared about. However, I suppose you would, and so
      we're all to be offered up on the altar of this twopenny-halfpenny promise
      you've made to Dr. Selwyn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you are," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything could have reconciled her to the sacrifice of inclination she
      had made in returning to Monkshaven, it would have been the warmth of the
      welcome extended to her on her arrival. Selwyn and Molly met her at the
      station, and Jane Crab, resplendent in a new cap and apron donned for the
      occasion, was at the gate when at last the pony brought the governess-cart
      to a standstill outside. Even Mrs. Selwyn had exerted herself to come
      downstairs, and was waiting in the hall to greet the wanderer back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a great comfort to have you back, my dear," she said with
      unwonted feeling in her voice, and quite suddenly Sara felt abundantly
      rewarded for the many weary hours upstairs, trying to win Mrs. Selwyn's
      interest to anything exterior to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're looking thinner," was Selwyn's blunt comment, as Sara threw off
      her hat and coat. "What have you been doing with yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, racketing about, I suppose. I've been living in a perfect whirl.
      Never mind, Doctor Dick, you shall fatten me up now with your good country
      food and your good country air. Good gracious!"&mdash;as he closed a big
      thumb and finger around her slender wrist and shook his head disparagingly&mdash;"Don't
      look so solemn! I was always one of the lean kine, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that London has agreed with you," rumbled Selwyn
      discontentedly. "Your pulse is as jerky as a primitive cinema film. You'd
      better not be in such a hurry to run away from us again. Besides, we can't
      do without you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a mental jolt Sara recollected the fact of her approaching marriage.
      How on earth should she break it to these good friends of hers, who
      counted so much on her remaining with them, that within three months&mdash;the
      longest period Elisabeth would consent to wait&mdash;she would be leaving
      them permanently? It was manifestly impossible to pour such a douche of
      cold water into the midst of the joyful warmth of their welcome; and she
      decided to wait, at least until the next day, before acquainting them with
      the fact of her engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning came, the same arguments held good in favour of a further
      postponement, and, as the days slipped by, it became increasingly
      difficult to introduce the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, amid the change of environment and influence, Sara experienced a
      certain almost inevitable reaction of feeling. It was not that she
      actually regretted her engagement, but none the less she found herself
      supersensitively conscious of it, and she chafed against the thought of
      the congratulations and all the kindly, well-meant "fussation" which its
      announcement would entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told herself irritably that this was only because she had not yet had
      time to get used to the idea of regarding herself as Tim's future wife;
      that, later on, when she had grown more accustomed to it, the prospect of
      her friends' felicitations would appear less repugnant. She had to face
      the ultimate fact that marriage, for her, did not mean the crowning
      fulfillment of life; marriage with Tim would never be anything more than a
      substitute, a next best thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts in her mind, she finally decided to say nothing about
      her engagement for the present, but to pick up the threads of life at
      Sunnyside as though that crowded month in London, with its unexpected
      culmination, had never been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once taken, the decision afforded her a curious sense of respite and
      relief. It was very pleasant to drop back into the old habits of managing
      the Sunnyside <i>ménage</i>&mdash;making herself indispensable to Selwyn,
      humouring his wife, and keeping a watchful eye on Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, Sara found, was by far the most difficult part of her task,
      and the vague apprehensions she had formed, and to some extent shared with
      Selwyn before her visit to London, increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an essentially lovable, inconsequent creature, with a temper of an
      angel and the frankness of a child, Molly had become oddly nervous and
      irritable, flushing and paling suddenly for no apparent cause, and
      guardedly uncommunicative as to her comings and goings. She was oddly
      resentful of any manifestation of interest in her affairs, and snubbed
      Sara roundly when the latter ventured an injudicious inquiry as to whether
      Lester Kent were still in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How on earth should I know?" The golden-brown eyes met Sara's with a look
      of nervous defiance. "I'm not his keeper." Then, as though slightly
      ashamed of her outburst, she added more amiably: "I haven't been down to
      the Club for weeks. It's been so hot&mdash;and I suppose I've been lazy.
      But I'm going to-morrow. I shall be able to gratify your curiosity
      concerning Lester Kent when I come home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow?" Sara looks surprised. "But we promised to go to tea with
      Audrey to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly flushed and looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did we?" she said vaguely. "I'd forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you arrange to go to Oldhampton the next day instead?" continued
      Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly frowned a little. At last&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you what I'll do," she said agreeably. "I'll come back by the
      afternoon train and meet you at Greenacres." And with this concession Sara
      had to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea at Greenacres resolved itself into a kind of rarefied picnic, and, as
      Sara crossed the cool green lawns in the wake of a smart parlourmaid, she
      found that quite a considerable number of Audrey's friends&mdash;and
      enemies&mdash;were gathered together under the shade of the trees,
      partaking of tea and strawberries and cream. The <i>elite</i> of the
      neighbourhood might find many disagreeable things to say concerning Mrs.
      Maynard, but they were not in the least averse to accepting her
      hospitality whenever the opportunity presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's heart leapt suddenly as she descried Trent's lean, well-knit figure
      amongst those dotted about on the lawn. She had tried very hard to
      accustom herself to meet him with composure, but at each encounter,
      although outwardly quite cool, her pulses raced, and to-day, the first
      time she had seen him since her return from London, she felt as though all
      her nerves were outside her skin instead of underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking to Miles Herrick. The latter, lying back luxuriously in a
      deck-chair, proceeded to wave and beckon an enthusiastic greeting as soon
      as he caught sight of Sara, and rather reluctantly she responded to his
      signals and made her way towards the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel like a bloated sultan summoning one of the ladies of the harem to
      his presence," confessed Miles apologetically when he had shaken hands.
      "I've added a sprained ankle to my other disabilities," he continued
      cheerfully. "Hence my apparent laziness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara commiserated appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you manage to get here?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles gestured towards Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This man maintained that it was bad for my mental and moral health to
      brood alone at home while Lavinia went skipping off into society
      unchaperoned. So he fetched me along in his car."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes rested thoughtfully on Trent's face a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd how kindly and considerate he always showed himself towards
      Miles Herrick. Perhaps somewhere within him a responsive chord was touched
      by the evidence of the other man's broken life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Tennant is thinking that it's a case of the blind leading the blind
      for me to act as a cicerone into society," remarked Trent curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara winced at the repellent hardness of his tone, but she declined to
      take up the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad you persuaded Miles to come over," was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent's lips closed in a straight line. It seemed as though he were trying
      to resist the appeal of her gently given answer; and Miles, conscious of
      the antagonism in the atmosphere, interposed with some commonplace
      question concerning her visit to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're looking thinner than you were, Sara," he added critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little as she felt Trent's hawk-like glance sweep over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've been leading too gay a life," she said hastily. "The Durwards
      seem to know half London, so that we crowded about a dozen engagements
      into each day&mdash;and a few more into the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Durward</i>?" The word sprang violently from Trent's lips, almost as
      though jerked out of him, and Sara, glancing towards him in some
      astonishment, surprised a strange, suddenly vigilant expression in his
      face. It was immediately succeeded by a blank look of indifference, yet
      beneath the assumption of indifference his eyes seemed to burn with a kind
      of slumbering hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;the people I have been staying with," she explained. "Do you
      know them, by any chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really can't say," he replied carelessly. "Durward is not a very
      uncommon name, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their name was originally Lovell&mdash;they only acquired the Durward
      with some property. Mrs. Durward is an extraordinarily beautiful woman. I
      believe in her younger days she had half London in love with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara hardly knew why she felt impelled to supply so many particulars
      concerning the Durwards. After that first brief exclamation, Trent seemed
      to have lost interest, and appeared to be rather bored by the recital than
      otherwise. He made no comment when she had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you don't know them?" she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" He started slightly, as though recalled to the present by her
      question. "No. I haven't the pleasure to be numbered amongst Mrs.
      Durward's friends," he said quietly. "I have seen her, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very beautiful, don't you think?" persisted Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," he replied indifferently. And then, quite deliberately, he
      directed the conversation into another channel, leaving Sara feeling
      exactly as though a door had been slammed in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his old method of putting an end to a discussion that failed to
      please him&mdash;this arrogantly abrupt transition to another subject&mdash;and,
      though it served its immediate purpose, it was a method that had its
      weaknesses. If you deliberately hide behind a hedge, any one who catches
      you in the act naturally wonders why you are doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Miles looked a trifle astonished at Trent's curt dismissal of the
      Durward topic, and Sara, who had observed the strange expression that
      leaped into his eyes&mdash;half-guarded, half inimical&mdash;felt
      convinced that he knew more about the Durwards than he had chosen to
      acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not imagine in what way they were connected with his life, nor
      why he should have been so averse to admitting his knowledge of them. But
      there were many inexplicable circumstances associated with the man who had
      chosen to live more or less the life of a recluse at Far End; and Sara,
      and the little circle of intimates who had at last succeeded in drawing
      him into their midst, had accustomed themselves to the atmosphere of
      secrecy that seemed to envelope him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his obvious desire to eschew the society of his fellow men and women,
      and from the acid cynicism of his outlook on things in general, it had
      been gradually assumed amongst them that some happenings in the past had
      marred his life, poisoning the springs of faith, and hope, and charity at
      their very fount, and with the tact of real friendship they never sought
      to discover what he so evidently wished concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Molly to-day?" Miles's pleasant voice broke across the awkward
      moment, giving yet a fresh trend to the conversation that was languishing
      uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's gaze ranged searchingly over the little groups of people sprinkled
      about the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she here yet?" she asked, startled. "She was coming back from
      Oldhampton by the afternoon train, and promised to meet me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The attractions of Oldhampton have evidently proved too strong for her,"
      he said a little drily. "If she had come by the afternoon train, she would
      have been here an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but she <i>must</i> be here&mdash;somewhere," she insisted rather
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I see if I can find her for you?" suggested Trent stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, sensing his wish to be gone and genuinely disturbed at Molly's
      non-appearance, acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be very glad if you would," she answered. Then turning to Miles,
      she went on: "I can't think where she can be. Somehow, Molly has become
      rather&mdash;difficult, lately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't look so distressed. It is only a little ebullition of <i>la
      jeunesse</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara turned to him swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you've noticed it, too&mdash;that she is different?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lookers-on see most of the game, you know. And I'm essentially a
      looker-on." He bit back a quick sigh, and went on hastily: "But I don't
      think you need worry about our Molly's vagaries. She's too sound <i>au
      fond</i> to get into real mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wouldn't mean to," conceded Sara. "But she is&mdash;&mdash;" She
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youthfully irresponsible," suggested Miles. "Let it go at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked at him affectionately, reflecting that Trent's black cynicism
      made a striking foil to the serene and constant charity of Herrick's
      outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always look for the best in people, Miles," she said appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to. Don't you see, people are my whole world. I'm cut off from
      everything else. If I didn't look for the best in them, I should want to
      kill myself. And I'm pretty lucky," he added, smiling humorously. "I
      generally find what I'm looking for."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Trent returned with the news that Molly was nowhere to be
      found. It was evident she had not come to Greenacres at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara rose, feeling oddly apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think I shall go home and see if she has arrived there yet," she
      said. She smiled down at Miles. "Even irresponsibility needs checking&mdash;if
      carried too far."

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FLIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first person Sara encountered on her return to Sunnyside was Jane
      Crab, unmistakably bursting to impart some news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor's going away, miss," she announced, flinging her bombshell
      without preliminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going away?" Sara's surprise was entirely gratifying, and Jane continued
      volubly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss. A telegram came for him early in the afternoon, while he was
      out on his rounds, asking him to go to a friend who is lying at death's
      door, as you may say. And please, miss, Dr. Selwyn said he would be glad
      to see you as soon as you came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I'll go to him at once. Where is Miss Molly? Has she come back
      yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and gone again, miss. The doctor asked her to send off a wire for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see." Sara nodded somewhat abstractly. She was still wondering
      confusedly why Molly had failed to put in any appearance at Greenacres.
      "What time did she come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About a quarter of an hour ago, miss. She missed the early train back
      from Oldhampton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's instant feeling of relief was tempered by a mild element of
      self-reproach. She had been agitating herself about nothing&mdash;allowing
      her uneasiness about Molly to become a perfect obsession, leading her into
      the wildest imaginings. Here had she been disquieting herself the entire
      afternoon because Molly had not turned up as arranged, and after all, the
      simple, commonplace explanation of the matter was that she had missed her
      train!
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling over the groundlessness of her fears, Sara hastened away to
      Selwyn's study, and found him, seated at his desk, scribbling some hurried
      motes concerning various cases among his patients for the enlightenment of
      the medical man who was taking charge of the practice during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there you are, Sara!" he exclaimed, laying down his pen as she
      entered. "I'm glad you have come back before I go. I'm off in
      half-an-hour. Did Jane tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I'm very sorry your friend is so ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn's face clouded over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to see him again," he answered simply. "We haven't met for some
      years&mdash;not since my wife's health brought me to Monkshaven&mdash;but
      we were good pals at one time, he and I. Luckily, I've been able to
      arrange with Dr. Mitchell to include my patients in his round, and if
      you'll take charge of everything here at home, Sara, I shall have nothing
      to worry about while I'm away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will. It's very nice of you to entrust your family to my care
      so confidently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite confidently," he replied. "I'm not afraid of anything going wrong
      if you're at the helm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long do you expect to be away?" asked Sara presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A couple of days at the outside. I hope to get back the day after
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Denuded of Selwyn's big, kindly presence, the house seemed curiously
      silent. Even Jane Crab appeared to feel the effect of his absence, and
      strove less forcefully with her pots and pans&mdash;which undoubtedly made
      for an increase of peace and quiet&mdash;while Molly was frankly
      depressed, stealing restlessly in and out of the rooms like some haunting
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth's the matter with you?" Sara asked her laughingly. "Hasn't
      your father ever been away from home before? You're wandering about like
      an uneasy spirit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>am</i> an uneasy spirit," responded Molly bluntly. "I feel as though
      I'd a cold coming on, and I always like Dad to doctor me when I'm ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can doctor a cold," affirmed Sara briskly. "Put your feet in hot water
      and mustard to-night and stay in bed to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly considered the proposed remedies in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I <i>will</i> stay in bed to-morrow," she said, at last,
      reluctantly. "Should you mind? We were going down to see the Lavender
      Lady, you remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go alone. Anyway"&mdash;smiling&mdash;"if you're safely tucked up in
      bed, I shall know you're not getting into any mischief while Doctor Dick's
      away! But very likely the hot water and mustard will put you all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it will," agreed Molly hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, however, found her in bed, snuffling and complaining of
      headache, and pathetically resigned to the idea of spending the day
      between the sheets. Obviously she was in no fit state to inflict her
      company on other people, so, in the afternoon, after settling her
      comfortably with a new novel and a box of cigarettes at her bedside, Sara
      took her solitary way to Rose Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she found Garth Trent, sitting beside Herrick's couch and deep in an
      enthusiastic discussion of amateur photography. But, immediately on her
      entrance, the eager, interested expression died out of his face, and very
      shortly after tea he made his farewells, nor could any soft blandishments
      on the part of the Lavender Lady prevail upon him to remain longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara felt hurt and resentful. Since the day of the expedition to Devil's
      Hood Island, Trent had punctiliously avoided being in her company whenever
      circumstances would permit him to do so, and she was perfectly aware that
      it was her presence at Rose Cottage which was responsible for his early
      departure this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of anger flickered in the black depths of her eyes as he shook
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I've driven you away," she flashed at him beneath her breath,
      with a bitterness akin to his own. He made no answer, merely releasing her
      hand rather quickly, as though something in her words had flicked him on
      the raw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity Mr. Trent had to leave so soon," remarked Miss Lavinia, with
      innocent regret, when he had gone. "I'm afraid we shall never persuade him
      to be really sociable, poor dear man! He seems a little moody to-day,
      don't you think?"&mdash;hesitating delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a bore!" burst out Sara succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think that," he said. "But he's a very sick man. In my
      opinion, Trent's had his soul badly mauled at some time or other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He needn't advertise the fact, then," retorted Sara, unappeased. "We all
      get our share of ill-luck. Garth behaves as if he had the monopoly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some scars which can't be hidden," replied Miles quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled a little. There was never any evading Herrick's broad
      tolerance of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly an hour later when at last she took her way homewards,
      carrying in her heart, in spite of herself, something of the gentle
      serenity that seemed to be a part of the very atmosphere at Rose Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the calm and fragrance of a June evening awaited her. Little,
      delicate, sweet-smelling airs floated over the tops of the hedges from the
      fields beyond, and now and then a few stray notes of a blackbird's song
      stole out from a plantation near at hand, breaking off suddenly and dying
      down into drowsy, contented little cluckings and twitterings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the bay the sun was dipping towards the horizon, flinging along the
      face of the waters great shafts of lambent gold and orange, that split
      into a thousand particles of shimmering light as the ripples caught them
      up and played with them, and finally tossed them back again to the sun
      from the shining curve of a wave's sleek side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very tranquil and pleasant, and Sara strolled leisurely along,
      soothed into a half-waking dream by the peaceful influences of the moment.
      Even the manifold perplexities and tangles of life seemed to recede and
      diminish in importance at the touch of old Mother Nature's comforting
      hand. After all, there was much, very much, that was beautiful and
      pleasant still left to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is generally at moments like these, when we are sinking into a placid
      quiescence of endurance, that Fate sees fit to prod us into a more active
      frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this particular instance destiny manifested itself in the unassuming
      form of Black Brady, who slid suddenly down from the roadside hedge, amid
      a crackling of branches and rattle of rubble, and appeared in front of
      Sara's astonished eyes just as she was nearing home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon, miss"&mdash;Brady tugged at a forelock of curly black hair&mdash;"I
      was just on me way to your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Sunnyside? Why, is Mrs. Brady ill again?" asked Sara kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss, thank you, she's doing nicely." He paused a moment as though at
      a loss how to continue. Then he burst out: "It's about Miss Molly&mdash;the
      doctor bein' away and all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About Miss Molly?" Sara felt a sudden clutch at her heart. "What do you
      mean? Quick, Brady, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, miss, I've just seed 'er go off 'long o' Mr. Kent in his big
      motor-car. They took the London road, and"&mdash;here Brady shuffled his
      feet with much embarrassment&mdash;"seein' as Mr. Kent's a married man,
      I'll be bound he's up to no good wi' Miss Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could have stamped with vexation. The little fool&mdash;oh! The utter
      little <i>fool</i>&mdash;to go off joy-riding in an evening like that! A
      break-down of any kind, with a consequent delay in returning, and all
      Monkshaven would be buzzing with the tale!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, however, there was nothing to be done except to put Black
      Brady in his place and pray for Molly's speedy return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Brady," she said coldly, "I imagine Mr. Kent's a good enough driver
      to bring Miss Selwyn back safely. I don't think there's anything to worry
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Brady stared at her out of his sullen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't understood, miss," he said doggedly. "Mr. Kent isn't for
      bringing Miss Molly back again. They'd their luggage along wi' 'em in the
      car, and Mr. Kent, he stopped at the 'Cliff' to have the tank filled up
      and took a matter of another half-dozen cans o' petrol with 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the whole dreadful significance of the thing leaped into
      Sara's mind. Molly had bolted&mdash;run away with Lester Kent!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough now, in the flashlight kindled by Brady's slow,
      inexorable summing up of detail, to see the drift of recent happenings,
      the meaning of each small, disconcerting fact that added a fresh link to
      the chain of probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly's unwonted secretiveness; her strange, uncertain moods; her
      embarrassment at finding she was expected at Greenacres when she had
      presumably agreed to meet Lester Kent in Oldhampton; and, last of all, the
      sudden "cold" which had developed coincidentally with her father's absence
      from home and which had secured her freedom from any kind of supervision
      for the afternoon. And the opportunity of clinching arrangements&mdash;probably
      already planned and dependent only on a convenient moment&mdash;had been
      provided by her errand to the post office to send off her father's
      telegram&mdash;it being as easy to send two telegrams as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour ebbed slowly from Sara's face as full realization dawned upon
      her, and she swayed a little where she stood. With rough kindliness Brady
      stretched out a grimy hand and steadied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ere, don't' take on, miss. They won't get very far. I didn't, so to
      speak, <i>fill</i> the petrol tank"&mdash;with a grin&mdash;"and there
      ain't more than two o' they cans I slipped aboard the car as 'olds more'n
      air. The rest was empties"&mdash;the grin widened enjoyably&mdash;"which I
      shoved in well to the back. Mr. Kent won't travel eighty miles afore 'e
      calls a 'alt, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked at Brady's cunning, kindly face almost with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you do that?" she asked swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've owed Mr. Lester Kent summat these three years," he answered
      complacently. "And I never forgets to pay back. I owed you summat, too,
      Miss Tennant. I haven't forgot how you spoke up for me when I was catched
      poachin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara held out her hand to him impulsively, and Brady sheepishly extended
      his own grubby paw to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've more than paid me back, Brady," she said warmly. "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning away, she hurried up the road, leaving Brady staring alternately
      at his right hand and at her receding figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's rare gentry, is Miss Tennant," he remarked with conviction, and
      then slouched off to drink himself blind at "The Jolly Sailorman." Black
      Brady was, after all, only an inexplicable bundle of good and bad impulses&mdash;very
      much like his betters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the house, Sara fled breathlessly upstairs to Molly's room.
      Jane Crab was standing in the middle of it, staring dazedly at all the
      evidences of a hasty departure which surrounded her&mdash;an overturned
      chair here, an empty hat-box there, drawers pulled out, and clothes tossed
      heedlessly about in every direction. In her hand she held a chemist's
      parcel, neatly sealed and labeled; she was twisting it round and round in
      her trembling, gnarled old fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Sara's entrance, she turned with an exclamation of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Sara! I'm main glad you've come! Whatever's happened? Miss Molly
      was here in bed not three parts of an hour ago!" Then, her boot-button
      eyes still roving round the room, she made a sudden dart towards the
      dressing-table. "Here, miss, 'tis a note she's left for you!" she
      exclaimed, snatching it up and thrusting it into Sara's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in Molly's big, sprawling, childish hand, the note was a pathetic
      mixture of confession and apology&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel a perfect pig, Sara mine, leaving you behind to face Father, but
      it was my only chance of getting away, as I know Dad would have refused to
      let me marry for years and years. He never <i>will</i> realize that I'm
      grown-up. And Lester and I couldn't wait all that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt an awful fraud last night, letting you fuss over my supposed
      'cold,' you dear thing. Do forgive me. And you must come and stay with us
      the minute we get back from our honeymoon. We are to be married to-morrow
      morning. "&mdash;MOLLY.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;Don't worry&mdash;it's all quite proper and respectable. I'm
      to go straight to the house of one of Lester's sisters in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.P.S.&mdash;I'm frantically happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes were wet when she finished the perusal of the hastily
      scribbled letter. "We are to be married to-morrow morning!" The blind,
      pathetic confidence of it! And if Black Brady had spoken the truth, if
      Lester Kent were already a married man, to-morrow morning would convert
      the trusting, wayward baby of a woman, with her adorable inconsistencies
      and her big, generous heart, into something Sara dared not contemplate.
      The thought of the look in those brown-gold eyes, when Molly should know
      the truth, brought a lump into her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Jane Crab.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Jane," she said tersely. "Miss Molly's run away with Mr.
      Lester Kent. She thinks he's going to marry her. But he can't&mdash;he's
      married already&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sakes alive!" Just that one brief exclamation, and then suddenly Jane's
      lower lip began to work convulsively, and two tears squeezed themselves
      out of her little eyes, and her whole face puckered up like a baby's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara caught her by the arm and shook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't cry!" she said vehemently. "You haven't time! We've got to save her&mdash;we've
      got to get her back before any one knows. Do you understand? Stop crying
      at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane reacted promptly to the fierce imperative, and sniffingly choked back
      her tears. Suddenly her eyes fell on the little package from the chemist
      which she still held clutched in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The artfulness of her!" she ejaculated indignantly. "Asking me to go
      along to the chemist's and bring her back some aspirin for her headache!
      And me, like a fool, suspecting nothing, off I goes! There's the stuff!"&mdash;viciously
      flinging the chemist's parcel on to the floor. "Eh! Miss Molly'll have
      more than a headache to face, I'm thinking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she <i>mustn't</i>, Jane! We've got to get her back, somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Sara spoke with such assured conviction, she was inwardly racked
      with anxiety. What <i>could</i> they do&mdash;two forlorn women? And to
      whom could they turn for help? Miles? He was lame. He was no abler to help
      than they themselves. And Selwyn was away, out of reach!
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get her back," she repeated doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how, may I ask, Miss Sara?" inquired Jane bitterly. "Be you goin' to
      run after the motor-car, mayhap?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Sara was silent. The sarcastic query had set the spark to the
      tinder, and now she was thinking rapidly, some semblance of a plan
      emerging at last from the chaotic turmoil of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth Trent! He could help her! He had a car&mdash;Sara did not know its
      pace, but she was certain Trent could be trusted to get every ounce out of
      it that was possible. Between them&mdash;he and she&mdash;they would bring
      Molly back to safety!
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned swiftly to Jane Crab.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the stable and help me put in the Doctor's pony, Jane. You know
      how, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss, I've helped the master many a time. But you ain't going to
      catch no motor with old Toby, Miss Sara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't expect to. I'm gong to drive across to Far End. Mr. Trent
      will help us. Don't worry, Jane"&mdash;as the two made their way to the
      stable and Jane strangled a sob&mdash;"we'll bring Miss Molly back. And,
      listen! Mrs. Selwyn isn't to hear a word of this. Do you understand? If
      she asks you anything, tell her that Miss Molly and I are dining out.
      That'll be true enough, too," added Sara grimly, "if we dine at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane sniffed, and swallowed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss," she said submissively. "You and Miss Molly are dining out. I
      won't forget."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THEY WHO PURSUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Selwyn's pony had rarely before found himself hustled along at the pace at
      which Sara drove him. She let him take his time up the hills, knowing, as
      every good horse-woman knows, that if you press your horse against the
      hill, he will only flag the sooner and that you will lose more than you
      gain. But down the hills and along the flat, Sara, with hands and whip,
      kept Toby going at an amazing pace. Perhaps something of her own urgency
      communicated itself to the good-hearted beast, for he certainly made a
      great effort and brought her to Far End in a shorter time than she had
      deemed possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly as she pulled him to a standstill, the front door opened and Garth
      himself appeared. He had heard the unwonted sound of wheels on the drive,
      and now, as he recognized his late visitor, an expression of extreme
      surprise crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Tennant!" he exclaimed in astonished tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Can your man take my pony? And, please may I come in? I&mdash;I must
      see you alone for a few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent glanced at her searchingly as his ear caught the note of strain in
      her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning Judson to take charge of the pony and trap, he led the way into
      the comfortable, old fashioned hall and wheeled forward an armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down," he said composedly. "Now"&mdash;as she obeyed&mdash;"tell me
      what is the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner held a quiet friendliness. The chill indifference he had
      accorded her of late&mdash;even earlier that same day at Rose Cottage&mdash;had
      vanished, and his curiously bright eyes regarded her with sympathetic
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the man as he appeared at the moment, it was no difficult matter for
      Sara to unburden her heart, and a few minutes later he was in possession
      of all the facts concerning Molly's flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know whether Mr. Kent is really a married man or not," she added
      in conclusion. "Brady declares that he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," replied Trent curtly. "Very much married. His first wife divorced
      him, and, since then, he has married again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;&mdash;!" Sara half-rose from her seat, her face blanching. Not
      till that moment did she realize how much in her inmost heart she had been
      relying on the hope that Garth might be able to contradict Black Brady's
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry." Garth laid his hands on her shoulders and pushed her gently
      back into her chair again. "Don't worry. Thanks to Brady's stroke of
      genius about the petrol&mdash;I've evidently underestimated the man's good
      points&mdash;I think I can promise you that you shall have Miss Molly
      safely back at Sunnyside in the course of a few hours. That is, if you are
      willing to trust me in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will trust you," she answered simply. Somehow it seemed as
      though a great burden had been lifted from her shoulders since she had
      confided her trouble to Garth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said quietly. "Now, while Judson gets the car round, you
      must have a glass of wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;oh, no!"&mdash;hastily&mdash;"I don't want anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to know better than you do in this case," he replied, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the room, presently returning with a bottle of champagne and a
      couple of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please&mdash;I'd so much rather start at once," she protested. "I
      really don't want anything. Do let us hurry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, but I've no intention of starting until you have drunk this"&mdash;filling
      and handing one of the glasses to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than waste time in further argument, she accepted it, only to find
      that her hand was shaking uncontrollably, so that the edge of the glass
      chattered against her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I can't!" she gasped helplessly. Now that she had shared her
      burden of responsibility, the demands of the last half-hour's anxiety and
      strain were making themselves felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift movement Garth took the glass from her, and, supporting her
      with his other arm, held it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it down," he said authoritatively. Then, as she paused: "All of
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the wine had brought the colour back to her face, and she
      felt more like herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right, now," she said. "I'm sorry I was such a fool. But&mdash;but
      this business about Molly has given me rather a shock, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally. Now, if you're ready, we'll make a start."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and he surveyed her slight figure in its thin muslin gown with
      some amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite a suitable costume for motoring by night," he remarked. He
      picked up one of the two big fur coats Mrs. Judson had brought into the
      room. "Here, put this on." Then, when he had fastened it round her and
      turned the collar up about her neck, he stood looking at her for a moment
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of her slender form was hidden beneath the voluminous folds of
      the big coat, which had been originally designed to fit Garth's own
      proportions, and against the high fur collar her delicate cameo face, with
      its white skin and scarlet lips and its sombre, night-black eyes, emerged
      like some vivid flower from its sheath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beauty&mdash;in the garment of the Beast," he commented. Then, briskly:
      "Come along. Judson will have the car ready by now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara stepped into the car and he tucked the rugs carefully round her.
      Then, directing Judson to drive the Selwyn pony and trap back to
      Sunnyside, he took his place at the wheel and the car slid noiselessly
      away down the broad drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The surprising discovery of the doctor's pony and trap at Far End
      to-morrow morning would require explanation," he observed grimly to Sara.
      She blessed his thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Judson?" she asked. "Is he reliable? Or do you think he will&mdash;talk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judson," replied Garth, "has been in my service long enough to know the
      meaning of the word 'discretion.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent drove the car steadily enough through town, but, as soon as they
      emerged on to the great London main road, he let her out and they swept
      rapidly along through the lingering summer twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you nervous?" he asked. "Do you mind forty or fifty miles an hour
      when we've a clear stretch ahead of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eighty, if you like," she replied succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the car leap forward like a living thing beneath them as it
      gathered speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think&mdash;is it possible that we can overtake them?" she asked
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's got to be done," he answered, and she was conscious of the quiet
      driving-force that lay behind the speech&mdash;the stubborn resolution of
      the man which she had begun to recognize as his most dominant
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered, as she had so often wondered before, whether any one had
      ever yet succeeded in turning Garth Trent aside from his set purpose,
      whatever it might chance to be. She could not imagine his yielding to
      either threats or persuasions. However much it might cost him, he would
      carry out his intention to the bitter end, even though its fulfillment
      might involve the shattering of the whole significance of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides,"&mdash;his voice cut across the familiar tenor of her thoughts&mdash;"Kent
      will probably stop to dine at some hotel <i>en route</i>. We shan't. We'll
      feed as we go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;h!" A gasp of horrified recollection escaped her. "I never
      thought of it! Of course you've had no dinner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. "Have you?" he asked amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but that's different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll even matters up by having some sandwiches together presently.
      Mrs. Judson has packed some in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was silent, inwardly dwelling on the fact that no least detail ever
      seemed to escape Garth's attention. Even in the hurry of their departure,
      and with the whole scheme of Molly's rescue to envisage, he had yet found
      time to order due provision for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later they pulled up at the principal hotel of the first big town
      on the route, and Garth elicited the fact that a car answering to the
      description of Lester Kent's had stopped there, but only for a bare ten
      minutes which had enabled its occupants to snatch a hasty meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've been here and gone straight on," he reported to Sara. "Evidently
      Kent's taking no chances"&mdash;grimly. And a moment later they were on
      their way once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk deepened into dark, and the car's great headlights cut out a blazing
      track of gold in front of them as they rushed along the pale ribbon of
      road that stretched ahead&mdash;mile after interminable mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side, dark woods merged into the deeper darkness of the
      encroaching night, seeming to slip past them like some ghostly marching
      army as the car tore its way between the ranks of shadowy trunks.
      Overhead, a few stars crept out, puncturing the expanse of darkening sky&mdash;pale,
      tremulous sparks of light in contrast with the steady, warmly golden glow
      that streamed from the lights of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Garth slackened speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you stopping?" Sara's voice, shrilling a little with anxiety,
      came to him out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not stopping. I'm only slowing down a bit, because I think it's quite
      feeding time. Do you mind opening those two leather attachments fixed in
      front of you? Such nectar and ambrosia as Mrs. Judson has provided is in
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara leaned forward, and unbuckling the lid of a flattish leather case
      which, together with another containing a flask, was slung just opposite
      her, withdrew from within it a silver sandwich-box. She snapped open the
      lid and proffered the box to Garth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself. And&mdash;do you mind"&mdash;he spoke a little uncertainly
      and the darkness hid the expression of his face from her&mdash;"handing me
      my share&mdash;in pieces suitable for human consumption? This is a bad bit
      of road, and I want both hands for driving the car."
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence Sara broke the sandwiches and fed him, piece by piece, while he
      bent over the wheel, driving steadily onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little, intimate action sent a curious thrill through her. It seemed
      in some way to draw them together, effacing the memory of those weeks of
      bitter indifference which lay behind them. Such a thing would have been
      grotesquely impossible of performance in the atmosphere of studied
      formality supplied by their estrangement, and Sara smiled a little to
      herself under cover of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One more mouthful!" she announced as she halved the last sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later she felt his lips brush her fingers in a sudden, burning
      kiss, and she withdrew her hand as though stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tingling from head to foot, every nerve of her a-thrill, and for a
      moment she felt as though she hated him. He had been so kind, so friendly,
      so essentially the good comrade in this crisis occasioned by Molly's
      flight, and now he had spoilt it all&mdash;playing the lover once more
      when he had shown her clearly that he meant nothing by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently he sensed her attitude&mdash;the quick withdrawal of spirit
      which had accompanied the more physical retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me!" he said, rather low. "I won't offend again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, and presently she felt the car sliding slowly to a
      standstill. A sudden panic assailed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? What are you doing?" she asked, quick fear in her sharply
      spoken question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be afraid&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not!" she interpolated hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," he said drily, "but you are. You don't trust me in the
      slightest degree. Well"&mdash;she could guess, rather than see, the shrug
      which accompanied the words&mdash;"I can't blame you. It's my own fault, I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      He braked the car, and she quivered to a dead stop, throbbing like a live
      thing in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must forgive me for being so material," he went on composedly, "but I
      want a drink, and I'm not acrobat enough to manage that, even with your
      help, while we're doing thirty miles an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted out the flask, and, when they had both drunk, Sara meekly took
      it from him and proceeded to adjust the screw cap and fit the silver cup
      back into its place over the lower half of the flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously she felt the car begin to move forward, and then, quite how
      it happened she never knew, but, fumbling in the darkness, she contrived
      to knock the cup sharply against the flask, and it flew out of her hand
      and over the side of the car. Impulsively she leaned out, trying to snatch
      it back as it fell, and, in the same instant, something seemed to give
      way, and she felt herself hurled forward into space. The earth rushed up
      to meet her, a sound as of many waters roared in her ears, and then the
      blank darkness of unconsciousness swallowed her up.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE REVELATION OF THE NIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Thank God, she's only stunned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, percolating slowly through the thick, blankety mist that seemed
      to have closed about her, impressed themselves on Sara's mind with a
      vague, confused suggestion of their pertinence. It was as though some one&mdash;she
      wasn't quite sure who&mdash;had suddenly given voice to her own immediate
      sensation of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she could not imagine for what reason she should feel so
      specially grateful and relieved. Gradually, however, the mists began to
      clear away and recollection of a kind returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered dropping something&mdash;she couldn't recall precisely what
      it was that she had dropped, but she knew she had made a wild clutch at it
      and tried to save it as it fell. Then&mdash;she was remembering more
      distinctly now&mdash;something against which she had been leaning&mdash;she
      couldn't recall what that was, either&mdash;gave way suddenly, and for the
      fraction of a second she had known she was going to fall and be killed,
      or, at the least, horribly hurt and mutilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, it seemed, she had not been hurt at all! She was in no pain; only
      her head felt unaccountably heavy. But for that, she was really very
      comfortable. Some one was holding her&mdash;it was almost like lying back
      in a chair&mdash;and against her cheek she could feel the soft warmth of
      fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara&mdash;beloved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Garth's voice, quite close to her ear. He was holding her in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! She knew now! They were on the island together, and he had just asked
      her if she cared. Of course she cared! It was sheer happiness to lie in
      his arms, with closed eyes, and hear his voice&mdash;that deep, unhappy
      voice of his&mdash;grow suddenly so incredibly soft and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're mine, now, sweet! Mine to hold just for this once, dear of my
      heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that couldn't be right, after all, because it wasn't Garth who loved
      her. He had only pretended to care for her by way of amusing himself. It
      must be Tim who was talking to her&mdash;Tim, whom she was going to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, the mists cleared quite away, and Sara came back to full
      consciousness and to the knowledge of where she was and of what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first instinct, to open her eyes and speak, was checked by a swift,
      unexpected movement on the part of Garth. All at once, he had gathered her
      up into his arms, and, holding her face pressed close against his own, was
      pouring into her ears a torrent of burning, passionate words of love&mdash;love
      triumphant, worshipping, agonizing, and last of all, brokenly, desperately
      abandoning all right or claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I've got to live without you . . . die without you . . . My God, it's
      hard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness and solitude of the night&mdash;as he believed, alone with
      the unconscious form of the woman he loved in his arms&mdash;Garth bared
      his very soul. There was nothing hidden any longer, and Sara knew at last
      that even as she herself loved, so was she loved again.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE JOURNEY'S END
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara stirred a little and opened her eyes. Deep within herself she was
      ashamed of those brief moments of assumed unconsciousness&mdash;those
      moments which had shown her a strong man's soul stripped naked of all
      pride and subterfuge&mdash;his heart and soul as he alone knew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, none the less, she felt gloriously happy. Nothing could ever hurt her
      badly again. Garth loved her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, for some reason, he himself would never have drawn aside the veil
      and let her know the truth, she was glad&mdash;glad that she had peered
      unbidden through the rent which the stress of the moment had torn in his
      iron self-command and reticence. Just as she had revealed herself to him
      on the island, in a moment of equal strain, so he had now revealed himself
      to her, and they were quits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right," she announced, struggling into a sitting position. "I'm
      not hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit still a minute, while I fetch you some brandy from the car." Garth
      spoke in a curiously controlled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back again in a moment, and the raw spirit made her catch her
      breath as it trickled down her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God we had only just begun to move," he said. "Otherwise you must
      have been half-killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened?" she asked curiously. "How did I fall out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The door came open. That damned fool, Judson, didn't shut it properly.
      Are you sure you're not hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure. My head aches rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very probable. You were stunned for a minute or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the recollection of their errand returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly! Good Heavens, how much time have we wasted? How long has this
      silly business taken?" she demanded, in a frenzy of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth surveyed her oddly in the glow of one of the car's side-lights,
      which he had carried back with him when he fetched the brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five minutes, I should think," he said, adding under his breath: "Or half
      eternity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five minutes! Is that all? Then do let's hurry on."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a few steps in the direction of the car, then stopped and
      wavered. She felt curiously shaky, and her legs seemed as though they did
      not belong to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Garth was at her side, and had lifted her up in his arms. He
      carried her swiftly across the few yards that intervened between them and
      the car, and settled her gently into her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you feel fit to go on?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do. We must&mdash;bring Molly back." Even her voice refused
      to obey the dictates of her brain, and quavered weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, try to rest a little. Don't talk, and perhaps you'll go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      He restarted the car, and, taking his seat once more at the wheel, drove
      on at a smooth and easy pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara leaned back in silence at his side, conscious of a feeling of utter
      lassitude. In spite of her anxiety about Molly, a curious contentment had
      stolen over her. The long strain of the past weeks had ended&mdash;ended
      in the knowledge that Garth loved her, and nothing else seemed to matter
      very much. Moreover, she was physically exhausted. Her fall had shaken her
      badly, and she wanted nothing better than to lie back quietly against the
      padded cushions of the car, lulled by the rhythmic throb of the engine,
      and glide on through the night indefinitely, knowing that Garth was there,
      close to her, all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her quiet, even breathing told that she slept, and Garth,
      stooping over her to make sure, accelerated the speed, and soon the car
      shot forward through the darkness at a pace which none but a driver very
      certain of his skill would have dared to attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, an hour later, Sara awoke, she felt amazingly refreshed. Only a
      slight headache remained to remind her of her recent accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are we?" she asked eagerly. "How long have I been asleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling better?" queried Garth, reassured by the stronger note in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite all right, thanks. But tell me where we are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly at our journey's end, I take it," he replied grimly, suddenly
      slackening speed. "There's a stationary car ahead there on the left, do
      you see? That will be our friends, I expect, held up by petrol shortage,
      thanks to Jim Brady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara peered ahead, and on the edge of the broad ribbon of light that
      stretched in front of them she could discern a big car, drawn up to one
      side of the road, its headlights shut off, its side-lights glimmering
      warningly against its dark bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly as they drew level with it, Garth pulled up to a standstill. Then
      a muttered curse escaped him, and simultaneously Sara gave vent to an
      exclamation of dismay. The car was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth sprang out and flashed a lamp over the derelict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "that's Kent's car right enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can have become of them?" she exclaimed. She glanced round her as
      though she half suspected that Kent and Molly might be hiding by the
      roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Garth had peered into the tank and was examining the petrol cans
      stowed away in the back of the deserted car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run dry!" he announced, coming back to his own car. "That's what has
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can we do now?" asked Sara despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faint heart!" he chided. "What can we do now? Why, ask ourselves what
      Kent would naturally have done when he found himself landed high and dry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what he <i>could</i> do&mdash;in the middle of nowhere?" she
      answered doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only we don't happen to be in the middle of nowhere! We're just about a
      couple of miles from a market town where abides a nice little inn whence
      petrol can be obtained. Kent and Miss Molly have doubtless trudged there
      on foot, and wakened up mine host, and they'll hire a trap and drive back
      with a fresh supply of oil. By Jove!"&mdash;with a grim laugh&mdash;"How
      Kent must have cursed when he discovered the trick Brady played on him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, leaving their car outside, Garth and Sara walked boldly
      up to the inn of which he had spoken. The door stood open, and a light was
      burning in the coffee-room. Evidently some one had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth glanced into the room, then, standing back, he motioned Sara to
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara stepped quickly over the threshold and then paused, swept by an
      infinite compassion and tenderness almost maternal in its solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly was sitting hunched up in a chair, her face half hidden against her
      arm, every drooping line of her slight young figure bespeaking weariness.
      She had taken off her hat and tossed it on to the table, and now she had
      dropped into a brief, uneasy slumber born of sheer fatigue and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Sara's voice she opened big, startled eyes and stared
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara moved swiftly to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly dear," she said, "I've come to take you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Molly started up, broad awake in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? How did you come here?" she stammered. Then, realization waking in
      her eyes: "But I'm not coming back with you. We've only stopped for
      petrol. Lester's outside, somewhere, seeing about it now. We're driving
      back to the car."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. But you're not going on with Mr. Kent"&mdash;very gently&mdash;"you're
      coming home with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly drew herself up, flaring passionate young defiance, talking glibly
      of love, and marriage, and living her own life&mdash;all the beautiful,
      romantic nonsense that comes so readily to the soft lips of youth, the
      beckoning rose and gold of sunrise&mdash;and of mirage&mdash;which is all
      youth's untrained eyes can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was getting desperate. The time was flying. At any moment Kent might
      return. Garth signaled to her from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell her," he said gruffly. "If Kent returns before we go, we
      shall have a scene. Get her away quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded. Then she came back to Molly's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said pitifully. "You can never marry Lester Kent, because&mdash;because
      he has a wife already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it!" The swift denial leaped from Molly's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did believe it, nevertheless. No one who knew Sara could have
      looked into her eyes at that moment and doubted that she was speaking not
      only what she believed to be, but what she <i>knew</i> to be, the ugly
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Molly crumpled up. As, between them, Garth and Sara hurried her
      away to the car, there was no longer anything of the regal young goddess
      about her. She was just a child&mdash;a tired, frightened child whose eyes
      had been suddenly opened to the quicksands whereon her feet were set, and,
      like a child, she turned instinctively and clung to the dear, familiar
      people from home, who were mercifully at hand to shield her when her whole
      world had suddenly grown new and strange and very terrible. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on through the night roared the big car, with Garth bending low over
      the wheel in front, while, in the back-seat Molly huddled forlornly into
      the curve of Sara's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few questions had elicited the whole foolish story of Lester Kent's
      infatuation, and of the steps he had taken to enmesh poor simple-hearted
      Molly in the toils&mdash;first, by lending her money, then, when he found
      that the loan had scared her, by buying her pictures and surrounding her
      with an atmosphere of adulation which momentarily blinded her from forming
      any genuine estimate either of the value of his criticism or of the
      sincerity of his desire to purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the head resting against Sara's shoulder was lifted, and a wistfully
      incredulous voice asked, very low&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sure he is married, Sara,&mdash;<i>quite sure</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure, Molly," came the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And later, as they were nearing home, Molly's hardly-bought philosophy of
      life revealed itself in the brief comment: "It's very easy to make a fool
      of oneself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably Mr. Kent has found that out&mdash;by this time," replied Sara
      with a grim flash of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint, involuntary chuckle in response premised that ultimately Molly
      might be able to take a less despondent view of the night's proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was between two and three in the morning when at length the travelers
      climbed stiffly out of the car at the gateway of Sunnyside and made their
      way up the little tiled path that led to the front door. The latter opened
      noiselessly at their approach and Jane, who had evidently been watching
      for them, stood on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her small, beady eyes were red-rimmed with sleeplessness&mdash;and with
      the slow, difficult tears that now and again had overflowed as hour after
      hour crawled by, bringing no sign of the wanderers' return&mdash;and the
      shadows of fatigue that had hollowed her weather-beaten cheeks wrung a
      sympathetic pang from Sara's heart as she realized what those long,
      inactive hours of helpless anxiety must have meant to the faithful soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's glance flew to the drooping, willowy figure clinging to Garth's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lamb! . . . Oh! Miss Molly dear, they've brought 'ee back!"
      Impulsively she caught hold of Garth's coat-sleeve. "Thank God you've
      brought them back, sir, and now there's none as need ever know aught but
      that they've been in their beds all the blessed night!" Her lips were
      shaking, drawn down at the corners like those of a distressed child, but
      her harsh old voice quivered triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very kindly gleam showed itself in Garth's dark face as he patted the
      rough, red hand that clutched his coat-sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I've brought them back safely," he said. "Put them to bed, Jane.
      Miss Sara's fallen out of the car and Miss Molly has tumbled out of
      heaven, so they're both feeling pretty sore."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sara's soreness was far the easier to bear, since it was purely
      physical. As she lay in bed, at last, utterly weary and exhausted, the
      recollection of all the horror and anxiety that had followed upon the
      discovery of Molly's flight fell away from her, and she was only conscious
      that had it not been for that wild night-ride which Molly's danger had
      compelled, she would never have known that Garth loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, out of evil, had come good; out of black darkness had been born the
      exquisite clear shining of the dawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SECOND BEST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sara laid down her pen and very soberly re-read the letter she had just
      written. It was to Tim Durward, telling him the engagement between them
      must be at an end, and its accomplishment had been a matter of sore
      embarrassment and mental struggle. Sara hated giving pain, and she knew
      that this letter, taking from Tim all&mdash;and it was so painfully little&mdash;that
      she had ever given him, must bring very bitter pain to the man to whom, as
      friend and comrade, she was deeply attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was barely a month since she had promised to marry him, and it was a
      difficult, ungracious task, and very open to misapprehension, to write and
      rescind that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was characteristic of Sara that no other alternative presented
      itself to her. Now that she was sure Garth cared for her&mdash;whether
      their mutual love must remain for ever unfulfilled, unconsummated, or not&mdash;she
      knew that she could never give herself to any other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She folded and sealed the letter, and then sat quietly contemplating the
      consequences that it might entail. Almost inevitably it would mean a
      complete estrangement from the Durwards. Elisabeth would be very unlikely
      ever to forgive her for her treatment of Tim; even kindly hearted Major
      Durward could not but feel sore about it; and since Garth had not asked
      her to marry him&mdash;and showed no disposition to do any such thing&mdash;they
      would almost certainly fail to understand or sympathize with her point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sighed as she dropped her missive into the letter-box. It meant an
      end to the pleasant and delightful friendship which had come into her life
      just at the time when Patrick Lovell's death had left it very empty and
      desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days of suspense ensued while she restlessly awaited Tim's reply.
      Then, on the third day, he came himself, his eyes incredulous, his face
      showing traces of the white night her letter had cost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very gentle with her. There was no bitterness or upbraiding, and he
      suffered her explanation with a grave patience that hurt her more than any
      reproaches he could have uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believed it was only I who cared, Tim," she told him. "And so I felt
      free to give you what you wanted&mdash;to be your wife, if you cared to
      take me, knowing I had no love to give. I thought"&mdash;she faltered a
      little&mdash;"that I might as well make <i>someone</i> happy! But now that
      I know he loves me as I love him, I couldn't marry any one else, could I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you going to marry him&mdash;this man you love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. He has not asked me to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he is married already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara met his eyes frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know even that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim made a fierce gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it playing fair&mdash;to keep you in ignorance like that?" he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. But somehow I don't mind. I am sure he must have a good
      reason&mdash;or else"&mdash;with a flash of humour&mdash;"some silly man's
      reason that won't be any obstacle at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing"&mdash;Tim bent over her, his face rather white&mdash;"supposing
      you find&mdash;later on&mdash;that there is some real obstacle&mdash;that
      he can't marry you, would you come to me&mdash;then, Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Tim, not now. Don't you see, now that I know he cares for me&mdash;everything
      is altered. I'm not free, now. In a way, I belong to him. Oh! How can I
      explain? Even though we may never marry, there is a faithfulness of the
      spirit, Tim. It's&mdash;it's the biggest part of love, really&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off, and presently she felt Tim's hands on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I understand, dear," he said gently. "It's just what I should
      expect of you. It means the end of everything&mdash;everything that
      matters for me. But&mdash;somehow&mdash;I would not have you otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stay very long after that. They talked together a little,
      promising each other that their friendship should still remain unbroken
      and unspoilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For," as Tim said, "if I cannot have the best that the world can give&mdash;your
      love, Sara, I need not lose the second best&mdash;which is your
      friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sara, watching him from the window as he strode away down the little
      tiled path, wondered why love comes so often bearing roses in one hand and
      a sharp goad in the other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PITILESS ALTAR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Elisabeth was pacing restlessly up and down the broad, flagged terrace at
      Barrow, impatiently awaiting Tim's return from Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew his errand there. He had scarcely needed to tell her the contents
      of Sara's letter, so swiftly had she summed up the immediate connection
      between the glimpse she had caught of Sara's handwriting and the shadow on
      the beloved face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved eagerly to meet him as she heard the soft purr of the motor
      coming up the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she queried, slipping her arm through his and drawing him towards
      the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim looked at her with troubled eyes. He could guess so exactly what her
      attitude would be, and he was not going to allow even Elisabeth to say
      unkind things about the woman he loved. If he could prevent it, she should
      not think them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very gently, and with infinite tact, he told her the result of his
      interview with Sara, concealing so far as might be his own incalculable
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his relief, his mother accepted the facts with unexpected tolerance. He
      could not see her expression, since her eyes veiled themselves with
      down-dropped lids, but she spoke quite quietly and as though trying to be
      fair in her judgment. There was no outward sign by which her son might
      guess the seething torrent of anger and resentment which had been aroused
      within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if, as you tell me, Sara doesn't expect to marry this man she cares
      for, surely she had been unduly hasty? If he can never be anything to her,
      need she set aside all thought of matrimony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim stared at his mother in some surprise. There was a superficial worldly
      wisdom in the speech which he would not have anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me rather absurd," she continued placidly. "Quixotic&mdash;the
      sort of romantic 'live and die unwed' idea that is quite exploded. Girls
      nowadays don't wither on their virgin stems if the man they want doesn't
      happen to be in a position to marry them. They marry some one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim felt almost shocked. From his childhood he had invested his mother
      with a kind of rarefied grace of mental and moral qualities commensurate
      with her physical beauty, and her enunciation of the cynical creed of
      modern times staggered him. It never occurred to him that Elisabeth was
      probing round in order to extract a clear idea of Sara's attitude in the
      whole matter, and he forthwith proceeded innocently to give her precisely
      the information she was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara isn't like that, mother," he said rather shortly. "It's just the&mdash;the
      crystal purity of her outlook which makes her what she is&mdash;so
      absolutely straight and fearless. She sees love, and holds by what she
      believes its demands to be. I wouldn't wish her any different," he added
      loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. But if&mdash;supposing the man proves to have a wife
      already? He might be separated from her; Sara doesn't seem to know much
      about him. Or he may have a wife in a lunatic asylum who is likely to live
      for the next forty years. What then? Will Sara never marry if&mdash;if
      there were a circumstance like that&mdash;a really insurmountable
      obstacle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't believe she will. I don't think she would wish to. If he
      loves her and she him, spiritually they would be bound to one another&mdash;lovers.
      And just the circumstance of his being tied to another woman would make no
      difference to Sara's point of view. She goes beyond material things&mdash;or
      the mere physical side of love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there is no chance for you unless Sara learns to <i>unlove</i> this
      man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim regarded her with faint amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, do you think you could learn to unlove me&mdash;or my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have me there, Tim," she acknowledged. "But"&mdash;hesitating a
      little&mdash;"Sara knows so little of the man, apparently, that she may
      have formed a mistaken estimate of his character. Perhaps he is not really
      the&mdash;the ideal individual she has pictured him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a very transparent person, mother mine," he said indulgently.
      "But I'm afraid your hopes of finding that the idol has feet of clay are
      predestined to disappointment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you met the man?" asked Elisabeth sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not even know his name. But I should imagine him a man of big, fine
      qualities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you don't know him, you can hardly pronounce an opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      A whimsical smile, touched with sadness, flitted across Tim's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know Sara," was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara is given to idealizing the people she cares for," rejoined
      Elisabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quietly, but her expression was curiously intent. It was as
      though she were gathering together her forces, concentrating them towards
      some definite purpose, veiled in the inscrutable depths of those strange
      eyes of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I find it difficult to forgive her," she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not like you, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is&mdash;just like me," she responded, a tone of half-tender mockery
      in her voice. "Naturally I find it difficult to forgive the woman who has
      hurt my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim answered her out of the fullness of the queer new wisdom with which
      love had endowed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man would rather be hurt by the woman he loves than humoured by the
      woman he doesn't love," he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Elisabeth, understanding, held her peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been very controlled, very wise and circumspect in her dealing
      with Tim, conscious of raw-edged nerves that would bear but the lightest
      of handling. But it was another woman altogether who, half-an-hour later,
      faced Geoffrey Durward in the seclusion of his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two moving factors in Elisabeth's life had been, primarily, her love
      for her husband, and, later on, her love for Tim, and into this later love
      was woven all the passionately protective instinct of the maternal
      element. She was the type of woman who would have plucked the feathers
      from an archangel's wing if she thought they would contribute to her son's
      happiness; and now, realizing that the latter was threatened by the fact
      that his love for Sara had failed to elicit a responsive fire, she felt
      bitterly resentful and indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Geoffrey," she declared in low, forceful tones, "she <i>shall</i>
      marry Tim&mdash;<i>she shall</i>! I will not have his beautiful young life
      marred and spoilt by the caprices of any woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Durward looked disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I shouldn't call Sara in the least a capricious woman. She knows
      her own heart&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So does Tim!" broke in Elisabeth. "And, if I can compass it, he shall
      have his heart's desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot force the issue, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I not? There's little a woman <i>cannot</i> do for husband or child!
      I tell you, Geoffrey&mdash;for you, or for Tim, to give you pleasure, to
      buy you happiness, I would sacrifice anybody in the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in front of him, her beautiful eyes glowing, and her voice was
      all shaken and a-thrill with the tumult of emotion that had gripped her.
      There was something about her which suggested a tigress on the defensive&mdash;at
      bay, shielding her young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durward looked at her with kind, adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's beautiful of you, darling," he replied gently. "But it's a
      dangerous doctrine. And I know that, really, you're far too tender-hearted
      to sacrifice a fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth regarded him oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know me, Geoffrey," she said very slowly. "No man knows a
      woman, really&mdash;not all her thoughts." And had Major Durward, honest
      fellow, realized the volcanic force of passion hidden behind the tense
      inscrutability of his wife's lovely face, he would have been utterly
      confounded. We do not plumb the deepest depths even of those who are
      closest to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civilisation had indeed forced the turgid river to run within the narrow
      channels hewn by established custom, but, released from the bondage of
      convention, the soul of Elisabeth Durward was that of sheer primitive
      woman, and the pivot of all her actions her love for her mate and for the
      man-child she had borne him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, years ago, she had sacrificed justice, and honour, and a man's faith
      in womanhood on that same pitiless altar of love. But the story of that
      sacrifice was known only to herself and one other&mdash;and that other was
      not Durward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LOVE'S SACRAMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      A full week had elapsed since the night of that eventful journey in
      pursuit of Molly, and from the moment when Garth had given Sara into the
      safe keeping of Jane Crab till the moment when he came upon her by the
      pergola at Rose Cottage, perched on the top of a ladder, engaged in tying
      back the exuberance of a Crimson Rambler, they had not met.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he halted at the foot of the ladder, Sara was conscious that
      her spirits had suddenly bounded up to impossible heights at the sight of
      the lean, dark face upturned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lavender Lady and Miles are pottering about in the greenhouse," she
      announced explanatorily, waving her hand in the direction of a distant
      glimmer of glass beyond the high box hedge which flanked the rose-garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they?" Trent, thus arrested in the progress of his search for his
      host and hostess, seemed entirely indifferent as to whether it were ever
      completed or not. He leaned against one of the rose-wreathed pillars of
      the pergola and gazed negligently in the direction Sara indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is Miss Molly?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is just beginning to discard sackcloth and ashes for something more
      becoming," she informed him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good. Are you&mdash;are you all right after your tumble? I'm
      making these kind inquiries because, since it was my car out of which you
      elected to fall, I feel a sense of responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara descended from the ladder before she replied. Then she remarked
      composedly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has taken precisely seven days, apparently, for that sense of
      responsibility to develop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, for seven days my thirst for knowledge has been only
      restrained by the pointings of conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then"&mdash;she spoke rather low&mdash;"was it conscience pointing you&mdash;away
      from Sunnyside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His hazel eyes flashed over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was&mdash;discretion," he suggested. "Looking in at shop
      windows when one has an empty purse is a poor occupation&mdash;and one to
      be avoided."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you want to come?" she persisted gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half absently he had cut off a piece of dead wood from the rose-bush next
      him and was twisting it idly to and fro between his fingers. At her words,
      the dead wood stem snapped suddenly in his clenched hand. For an instant
      he seemed about to make some passionate rejoinder. Then he slowly
      unclenched his hand and the broken twig fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I made it clear to you&mdash;yet," he said slowly, "that what I
      want doesn't enter into the scheme of things at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The brief speech held a sense of impending finality, and, in the silence
      which followed, the eyes of the man and woman met, questioned each other
      desperately, and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when modesty is a false quantity, and when the big
      happinesses of life depend on a woman's capacity to realize this and her
      courage to act upon it. To Sara, it seemed that such a moment had come to
      her, and the absolute sincerity of her nature met it unafraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said quietly. "You have only made clear to me&mdash;what you
      want, Garth. Need we&mdash;pretend to each other any longer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you?" She drew a littler nearer him, and the face she lifted to his
      was very white. But her eyes were shining. "That night&mdash;when I fell
      from the car&mdash;I&mdash;I wasn't unconscious."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant he stared at her, incredulous. Then he swung aside a
      little, his hand gripping the pillar against which he had been leaning
      till his knuckles showed white beneath the straining skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;weren't unconscious?" he repeated blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not all the time. I&mdash;heard&mdash;what you said."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to pull himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Heaven only knows what I may have said at a moment like that," he
      answered carelessly, but his voice was rough and hoarse. "A man talks wild
      when the woman he's with only misses death by a hair's breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's lips upturned at the corners in a slow smile&mdash;a smile that was
      neither mocking, nor tender, nor chiding, but an exquisite blending of all
      three. She caught her breath quickly&mdash;Trent could hear its soft
      sibilance. Then she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you marry me, please, Garth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back from her, violently, his underlip hard bitten. At last, after
      a long silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he burst out harshly. "No! I can't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she was shaken. Then, buoyed up by the memory of that night
      when she had lain in his arms and when the agony of the moment had
      stripped him of all power to hide his love, she challenged his denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" Her voice was vibrant. "You love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes . . . I love you." The words seemed torn from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why won't you marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem to her that she was doing anything unusual or unwomanly.
      The man she loved had carried his burden single-handed long enough. The
      time had come when for his own sake as well as for hers, she must wring
      the truth from him, make him break through the silence which had long been
      torturing them both. Whatever might be the outcome, whether pain or
      happiness, they must share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why won't you marry me, Garth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little question, almost voiceless in its intensity, clamoured loudly
      at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tempt me!" he cried out hoarsely. "My God! I wonder if you know how
      you are tempting me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She came a little closer to him, laying her hand on his arm, while her
      great, sombre eyes silently entreated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though the touch of her were more than he could bear, his hard-held
      passion crashed suddenly through the bars his will had set about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her in his arms, lifting her sheer off her feet against his
      breast, whilst his lips crushed down upon her mouth and throat, burned
      against her white, closed lids, and the hard clasp of his arms about her
      was a physical pain&mdash;an exquisite agony that it was a fierce joy to
      suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;then you do love me?" She leaned against him, breathless, her
      voice unsteady, her whole slender body shaken with an answering passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love you?" The grip of his arms about her made response. "Love you? I
      love you with my soul and my body, here and through whatever comes
      Hereafter. You are my earth and heaven&mdash;the whole meaning of things&mdash;"
      He broke off abruptly, and she felt his arms slacken their hold and slowly
      unclasp as though impelled to it by some invisible force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was I saying?" The heat of passion had gone out of his voice,
      leaving it suddenly flat and toneless. "'The whole meaning of things?'" He
      gave a curious little laugh. It had a strangled sound, almost like the cry
      of some tortured thing. "Then things <i>have</i> no meaning&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara stood staring at him, bewildered and a little frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth, what is it?" she whispered. "What has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and, walking away from her a few paces, stood very still with
      his head bent and one hand covering his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead, the sunshine, filtering in through the green trellis of leafy
      twigs, flaunted gay little dancing patches of gold on the path below, as
      the leaves moved flickeringly in the breeze, and where the twisted growth
      of a branch had left a leafless aperture, it flung a single shaft of
      quivering light athwart the pergola. It gleamed like a shining sword
      between the man and woman, as though dividing them one from the other and
      thrusting each into the shadows that lay on either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her voice he dropped his hand to his side and came slowly
      back and stood beside her. His face was almost grey, and the tortured
      expression of his eyes seemed to hurt her like the stab of a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must try to forgive me," he said, speaking very low and rapidly. "I
      had no earthly right to tell you that I cared, because&mdash;because I
      can't ask you to marry me. I told you once that I had forfeited my claim
      to the good things in life. That was true. And, having that knowledge, I
      ought to have kept away from you&mdash;for I knew how it was going to be
      with me from the first moment I saw you. I fought against it in the
      beginning&mdash;tried not to love you. Afterwards, I gave in, but I never
      dreamed that&mdash;you&mdash;would come to care, too. That seemed
      something quite beyond the bounds of human possibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did it? I can't see why it should?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you?" He smiled a little. "If you were a man who has lived under a
      cloud for over twenty years, who has nothing in the world to recommend
      him, and only a tarnished reputation as his life-work, you, too, would
      have thought it inconceivable. Anyway, I did, and, thinking that, I dared
      to give myself the pleasure of seeing you&mdash;of being sometimes in your
      company. Perhaps"&mdash;grimly&mdash;"it was as much a torture as a joy on
      occasion. . . . But still, I was near you. . . . I could see you&mdash;touch
      your hand&mdash;serve you, perhaps, in any little way that offered. That
      was all something&mdash;something very wonderful to come into a life that,
      to all intents and purposes, was over. And I thought I could keep myself
      in hand&mdash;never let you know that I cared&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly tried hard enough to convince me that you didn't," she
      interrupted ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I tried. And I failed. And now, all that remains is for me to go
      away. I shall never forgive myself for having brought pain into your life&mdash;I,
      who would so gladly have brought only happiness. . . . God in Heaven!"&mdash;he
      whispered to himself as though the thought were almost blinding in the
      promise of ecstasy it held&mdash;"To have been the one to bring you
      happiness! . . ." He fell silent, his mouth wrung and twisted with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her voice came to him again, softly supplicating. "I shall never
      forgive you&mdash;if you go away and leave me," she added. "I can't do
      without you now&mdash;now that I know you care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I <i>must</i> go! I can't marry you&mdash;you haven't understood&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I?" She smiled&mdash;a small, wise, wonderful smile that began
      somewhere deep in her heart and touched her lips and lingered in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she said. "Are you married, Garth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married! God forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you married me, would you be wronging any one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only you yourself," he answered grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then nothing else matters. You are free&mdash;and I'm free. And I love
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned towards him, her hands outheld, her mouth still touched with
      that little, mystic smile. "Please&mdash;tell me all over again now much
      you love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But no answering hands met hers. Instead, he drew away from her and faced
      her, stern-lipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must make you understand," he said. "You don't know what it is that you
      are asking. I've made shipwreck of my life, and I must pay the penalty.
      But, by God, I'm not going to let you pay it, too! And if you married me,
      you would have to pay. You would be joining your life to that of an
      outcast. I can never go out into the world as other men may. If I did"&mdash;slowly&mdash;"if
      I did, sooner or later I should be driven away&mdash;thrust back into my
      solitude. I have nothing to offer&mdash;nothing to give&mdash;only a life
      that has been cursed from the outset. Don't misunderstand me," he went on
      quickly. "I'm not complaining, bidding for your sympathy. If a man's a
      fool, he must be prepared to pay for his folly&mdash;even though it means
      a life penalty for a moment's madness. And I shall have to pay&mdash;to
      the uttermost farthing. Mine's the kind of debt which destiny never
      remits." He paused; then added defiantly: "The woman who married me would
      have to share in that payment&mdash;to go out with me into the desert in
      which I lie, and she would have to do this without knowing what she was
      paying for, or why the door of the world is locked against me. My lips are
      sealed, nor shall I ever be able to break the seal. <i>Now</i> do you
      understand why I can never ask you, or any other woman to be my wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara looked at him curiously; he could not read the expression of her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you finished?" she asked. "Is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All? Isn't it enough?"&mdash;with a grim laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are letting this&mdash;this folly of your youth stand between
      us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world applies a harder word than folly to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care anything at all about the world. What do <i>you</i> call
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I call it folly to ask the criminal in the dock whether he approves the
      judge's verdict. He's hardly likely to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was silent. Then she seemed to gather herself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth, do you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words fell clearly on the still, summer air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes"&mdash;doggedly&mdash;"I love you. What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then? Why&mdash;this! I don't care what you've done. It doesn't
      matter to me whether you are an outcast or not. If you are, then I'm
      willing to be an outcast with you. Oh, Garth&mdash;My Garth! I've been
      begging you to marry me all afternoon, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" with a
      broken little laugh&mdash;"you can't <i>keep on</i> refusing me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her passionate faith and trust the barriers he had raised between
      them came crashing down. His arms went round her, and for a few moments
      they clung together and love wiped out all bitter memories of the past and
      all the menace of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently he came back to his senses. Very gently he put her from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not right," he stammered unsteadily. "I can't accept this from you.
      Dear, you must let me go away. . . . I can't spoil your beautiful life by
      joining it to mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew his arm about her shoulders again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will spoil it if you go away. Oh! Garth, you dear, foolish man! When
      will you understand that love is the only thing that matters? If you had
      committed all the sins in the Decalogue, I shouldn't care! You're mine
      now"&mdash;jealously&mdash;"my lover. And I'm not going to be thrust out
      of your life for some stupid scruple. Let the past take care of itself.
      The present is ours. And&mdash;and I love you, Garth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to reason coolly with her arms about him, her lips so
      near his own, and his great love for her pulling at his heart. But he made
      one further effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you should ever regret it, Sara?" he whispered. "I don't think I could
      bear that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with steady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not have it to bear," she said. "I shall never regret it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he hesitated. But the dawn of a great hope grew and deepened in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could be content to live here&mdash;at Far End . . . It is just
      possible!" He spoke reflectively, as though debating the matter with
      himself. "The curse has not followed me to this quiet little corner of the
      earth. Perhaps&mdash;after all . . . Sara, could you stand such a life? Or
      would you always be longing to get out into the great world? As I've told
      you, the world is shut to me. There's that in my past which blocks the way
      to any future. Have you the faith&mdash;the <i>courage</i>&mdash;to face
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, steadfast and serene, met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have courage to face anything&mdash;with you, Garth. But I haven't
      courage to face living without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head and kissed her on the mouth&mdash;a slow, lingering kiss
      that held something far deeper and more enduring than mere passion. And
      Sara, as she kissed him back, her soul upon her lips, felt as though
      together they had partaken of love's holy sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beloved"&mdash;Garth's voice, unspeakably tender, came to her through the
      exquisite silence of the moment&mdash;"Beloved, it shall be as you wish.
      Whether I am right or wrong in taking this great gift you offer me&mdash;God
      knows! If I am wrong&mdash;then, please Heaven, whatever punishment there
      be may fall on me alone."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A SUMMER IDYLL
    </h3>
    <p>
      The summer, of all seasons of the year, is very surely the perfect time
      for lovers, and to Sara the days that followed immediately upon her
      engagement to Garth Trent were days of unalloyed happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were wonderful hours which they passed together, strolling through
      the summer-foliaged woods, or lazing on the sun-baked sands, or, perhaps,
      roaming the range of undulating cliffs that stretched away to the west
      from the headland where Far End stood guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those hours of intimate companionship, Sara began to learn the
      hidden deeps of Garth's nature, discovering the almost romantic delicacy
      of thought that underlay his harsh exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're more than half a poet, my Garth!" she told him one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A transcendental fool, in other words," he amended, smiling. "Well"&mdash;looking
      at her oddly&mdash;"perhaps you're right. But it's too late to improve me
      any. As the twig is bent, so the tree grows, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to improve you," Sara assured him promptly. "I shouldn't
      like you to be in the least bit different from what you are. It wouldn't
      be my Garth, then, at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they would sit together and talk the foolish, charming nonsense that
      all lovers have talked since the days of Adam and Eve, whilst from above,
      the sun shone down and blessed them, and the waves, lapping peacefully on
      the shore, murmured an <i>obbligato</i> to their love-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking backward, in the bitter months that followed when her individual
      happiness had been caught away from her in a whirlwind of calamity, and
      when the whole world was reeling under the red storm of war, Sara could
      always remember the utter, satisfying peace of those golden days of early
      July&mdash;an innocent, unthinking peace that neither she nor the world
      would ever quite regain. Afterwards, memory would always have her scarred
      and bitter place at the back of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara found no hardship now in receiving the congratulations of her friends&mdash;and
      they fell about her like rain&mdash;while in the long, intimate talks she
      had with Garth the fact that he would never speak of the past weighed with
      her not at all. She guessed that long ago he had been guilty of some mad,
      boyish escapade which, with his exaggerated sense of honour and the
      delicate idealism that she had learned to know as an intrinsic part of his
      temperamental make-up, he had magnified into a cardinal sin. And she was
      content to leave it at that and to accept the present, gathering up with
      both hands the happiness it held.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written to Elisabeth, telling her of her engagement, and, to her
      surprise, had received the most charming and friendly letter in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," wrote Elisabeth in her impulsive, flowing hand with its heavy
      dashes and fly-away dots, "we cannot but wish that it had been otherwise&mdash;that
      you could have learned to care for Tim&mdash;but you know better than any
      one of us where your happiness lies, and you are right to take it. And
      never think, Sara, that this is going to make any difference to our
      friendship. I could read between the lines of your letter that you had
      some such foolish thought in your mind. So little do I mean this to make
      any break between us that&mdash;as I can quite realize it would be too
      much to ask that you should come to us at Barrow just now&mdash;I propose
      coming down to Monkshaven. I want to meet the lucky individual who has won
      my Sara. I have not been too well lately&mdash;the heat has tried me&mdash;and
      Geoffrey is anxious that I should go away to the sea for a little. So that
      all things seem to point to my coming to Monkshaven. Does your primitive
      little village boast a hotel? Or, if not, can you engage some decent rooms
      for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the letter dealt with the practical details concerning
      the proposed visit, and Sara, in a little flurry of joyous excitement, had
      hurried off to the Cliff Hotel and booked the best suite of rooms it
      contained for Elisabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way home she encountered Garth in the High Street, and forthwith
      proceeded to acquaint him with her news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just been fixing up rooms at the 'Cliff' for a friend of mine who is
      coming down here," she said, as he turned and fell into step beside her.
      "A woman friend," she added hastily, seeing his brows knit darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better! But I could have done without the importation of any
      friends of yours&mdash;male or female&mdash;just now. They're entirely
      superfluous"&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm glad Mrs. Durward is coming, because&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Who</i> did you say?" broke in Garth, pausing in his stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Durward&mdash;Tim's mother, you know," she explained. She had
      confided to him the history of her brief engagement to Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent resumed his walk, but more slowly; the buoyancy seemed suddenly gone
      out of his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think," he said, speaking in curiously measured tones, "that,
      in the circumstances, it will be a little awkward Mrs. Durward's coming
      here just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara disclaimed the idea, pointing out that it was the very completeness
      of Elisabeth's conception of friendship which was bringing her to
      Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When does she come?" asked Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Thursday. I'm very anxious for you to meet her, Garth. She is so
      thoroughly charming. I think it is splendid of her not to let my broken
      engagement with Tim make any difference between us. Most mothers would
      have borne a grudge for that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think Mrs. Durward has overlooked it?"&mdash;with a curious
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara enthusiastically assured him that this was the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder!" he said meditatively. "It would be very unlike Elis&mdash;unlike
      any woman"&mdash;he corrected himself hastily&mdash;"to give up a fixed
      idea so easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well"&mdash;Sara laughed gaily. "Nowadays you can't <i>compel</i> a
      person to marry the man she doesn't want&mdash;nor prevent her from
      marrying the man she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. A determined woman can do a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Elisabeth isn't a bit the determined type of female you're evidently
      imagining," protested Sara, amused. "She is very beautiful and essentially
      feminine&mdash;rather a wonderful kind of person, I think. Wait till you
      see her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid," said Trent slowly, "that I shall not see your charming
      friend. I have to run up to Town next week on&mdash;on business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Sara's disappointment showed itself in her voice. "Can't you put it
      off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted outside a tobacconist's shop. "Do you mind waiting a moment
      while I go in here and get some baccy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared into the shop, and Sara stood gazing idly across the
      street, watching a jolly little fox-terrier enjoying a small but meaty
      bone he had filched from the floor of a neighbouring butcher's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      His placid enjoyment of the stolen feast was short-lived. A minute later a
      lean and truculent Irish terrier came swaggering round the corner, spotted
      the succulent morsel, and, making one leap, landed fairly on top of the
      smaller dog. In an instant pandemonium arose, and the quiet street
      re-echoed to the noise of canine combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little fox-terrier put up a plucky fight in defence of his prior claim
      to the bone of contention, but soon superior weight began to tell, and it
      was evident that the Irishman was getting the better of the fray. The
      fox-terrier's owner, very elegantly dressed, watched the battle from a
      safe distance, wringing her hands and calling upon all and sundry of the
      small crowd which had speedily collected to save her darling from the
      lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, however, seemed disposed to relieve her of this office&mdash;for
      the Irishman was an ugly-looking customer&mdash;when suddenly, like a
      streak of light, a slim figure flashed across the road, and flung itself
      into the <i>melee</i>, whist a vibrating voice broke across the uproar
      with an imperative: "Let <i>go</i>, you brute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over in a moment. Somehow Sara's small, strong hands had
      separated the twisting, growling, biting heap of dog into its component
      parts of fox and Irish, and she was standing with the little fox-terrier,
      panting and bleeding profusely, in her arms, while one or two of the
      bystanders&mdash;now that all danger was past&mdash;drove off the
      Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! But how <i>brave</i> of you!" The owner of the fox-terrier rustled
      forward. "I can't ever thank you sufficiently."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara turned to her, her black eyes blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this your dog?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And I'm sure"&mdash;volubly&mdash;"he would have been torn to pieces
      by that great hulking brute if you hadn't separated them. I should never
      have <i>dared</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth, coming out of the tobacconist's shop across the way, joined the
      little knot of people just in time to hear Sara answer cuttingly, as she
      put the terrier into its owner's arms&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've no business to <i>have</i> a dog if you've not got the pluck to
      look after him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she and Trent bent their steps homeward, Sara regaled him with the
      full, true, and particular account of the dog-fight, winding up
      indignantly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foul women like that ought not to be allowed to take out a dog licence. I
      hate people who shirk their responsibilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You despise cowards?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than anything on earth," she answered heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a moment. Then he said reflectively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, I suppose, a certain amount of allowance must be made for&mdash;nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me it depends on what your duty demands of you at the
      moment," she rejoined. "Nerves are a luxury. You can afford them when it
      makes no difference to other people whether you're afraid or not&mdash;but
      not when it does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And from what deeps did you draw such profound wisdom?" he asked
      quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had it well rubbed into me by my Uncle Patrick," she replied. "It was
      his <i>Credo</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, I can understand any one's nerves cracking suddenly&mdash;after
      a prolonged strain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think yours would," responded Sara contentedly, with a vivid
      recollection of their expedition to the island and its aftermath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly not. But I suppose no man can be dead sure of himself&mdash;always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in?" asked Sara as they paused at Sunnyside gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-day, I think. I had better begin to accustom myself to doing
      without you, as I am going away so soon"&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you were not going," she rejoined discontentedly. "I so wanted you
      and Elisabeth to meet. <i>Must</i> you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I must. And it's better that I should go, on the whole. I
      should only be raging up and down like an untied devil because Mrs.
      Durward was taking up so much of your time! Let her have you to herself
      for a few days&mdash;and then, when I come back, I shall have you to <i>myself</i>
      again."

    <h3>
      PATCHES OF BLUE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Elisabeth frowned a little as she perused the letter which she had that
      morning received from Sara. It contained the information that rooms in her
      name had been booked at the Cliff Hotel, and further, that Sara was much
      disappointed that it would be impossible to arrange for her to meet Garth
      Trent, as he was leaving home on the Wednesday prior to her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent's departure was the last thing Elisabeth desired. Above all things,
      she wanted to meet the man whom she regarded as the stumbling-block in the
      path of her son, for if it were possible that anything might yet be done
      to further the desire of Tim's heart, it could only be if Elisabeth, as
      the <i>dea ex machina</i>, were acquainted with all the pieces in the
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must know what manner of man it was who had succeeded in winning
      Sara's heart before she could hope to combat his influence, and, if the
      feet of clay were there, she must see them herself before she could point
      them out to Sara's love-illusioned eyes. Should she fail of making Trent's
      acquaintance, she would be fighting in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth pondered the matter for some time. Finally, she dispatched a
      telegram, prepaying a reply, to the proprietor of the Cliff Hotel, and a
      few hours later she announced to her husband that she proposed antedating
      her visit to Monkshaven by three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall go down the day after to-morrow&mdash;on Monday," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'd better send a wire to Sara," suggested Geoffrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't do that. I intend taking her by surprise." Elisabeth smiled and
      dimpled like a child in the possession of a secret. "I shall go down there
      just in time for dinner, and write to Sara the same evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Durward laughed with indulgent amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an absurd lady you are still, Beth!" he exclaimed, his honest face
      beaming adoration. "No one would take you to be the mother of a grown-up
      son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't they?" For a moment Elisabeth's eyes&mdash;veiled, enigmatical
      as ever&mdash;rested on Tim's distant figure, where he stood deep in the
      discussion of some knotty point with the head gardener. Then they came
      back to her husband's face, and she laughed lightly. "Everybody doesn't
      see me through the rose-coloured spectacles that you do, dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no 'rose-coloured spectacles' about it," protested Geoffrey
      energetically. "No one on earth would take you for a day more than thirty&mdash;if
      it weren't for the solid fact of Tim's six feet of bone and muscle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth jumped up and kissed her husband impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Geoffrey, you're a great dear," she declared warmly. "Now I must run off
      and tell Fanchette to pack my things."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that on the following Tuesday, Sara, to her astonishment
      and delight, received a letter from Elisabeth announcing her arrival at
      the Cliff Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Elisabeth is already here!" she exclaimed, addressing the family at
      Sunnyside collectively. "She came last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn looked up from his correspondence with a kindly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good. You will be able, after all, to bring off the projected
      meeting between Mrs. Durward and your hermit&mdash;who, by the way, seems
      to have deserted his shell nowadays," he added, twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sara, blissfully unaware that in this instance Elisabeth had abrogated
      to herself the rights of destiny, responded smilingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Fate has actually arranged things quite satisfactorily for once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later she presented herself at the Cliff Hotel, and was
      conducted upstairs to Mrs. Durward's sitting-room on the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth welcomed her with all her wonted charm and sweetness. There was
      a shade of gravity in her manner as she spoke of Sara's engagement, but no
      hint of annoyance. She dwelt solely on Tim's disappointment and her own,
      exhibiting no bitterness, but only a rather wistful regret that another
      had succeeded where Tim had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," she said, drawing Sara out on to the balcony, where she had
      been sitting prior to the latter's arrival, "and now, tell me about the
      lucky man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara found it a little difficult to describe the man she loved to the
      mother of the man she didn't love, but finally, by dint of skilful
      questioning, Elisabeth elicited the information she sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forty-three!" she exclaimed, as Sara vouchsafed his age. "But that's much
      too old for you, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," she smiled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems so to me," persisted Elisabeth, regarding her with judicial
      eyes. "Somehow you convey such an impression of youth. You always remind
      me of spring. You are so slim and straight and vital&mdash;like a young
      sapling. However, perhaps Mr. Trent also has the faculty of youth. Youth
      isn't a matter of years, after all," she added contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now go on," she commanded, after a moment. "Tell me what he looks like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed and plunged into a description of Garth's personal
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he's got queer eyes&mdash;tawny-coloured like a dog's," she wound up,
      "with a quaint little patch of blue close to each of the pupils."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth leaned forward, and beneath the soft laces of her gown the rise
      and fall of her breast quickened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patches of blue?" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;it sounds as though the colours had run, doesn't it?" pursued
      Sara, laughing a little. "But it's really rather effective."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you say his name was Trent&mdash;Garth Trent?" asked Elisabeth.
      She had gone a little grey about the mouth, and she moistened her lips
      with her tongue before speaking. There was a tone of incredulity in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It's not a beautiful name, is it?" smiled Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather a curious one," agreed Elisabeth with an effort. "I'm really
      quite longing to meet this odd man with the patchwork eyes and the funny
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall see him to-day," Sara promised. "Audrey Maynard is giving a
      picnic in Haven Woods, and Garth will be there. You will come with us,
      won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I must," replied Elisabeth. "Although"&mdash;negligently&mdash;"picnics
      are not much in my line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Audrey's picnics aren't like other people's," rejoined Sara
      reassuringly. "She runs them just as she runs everything else, on lines of
      combined perfection and informality! The lunch will be the production of a
      French chef, and the company a few carefully selected intimates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I'll come&mdash;if you're sure Mrs. Maynard won't object to
      the introduction of a complete stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara regarded her affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever met any one who 'objected' to you yet?" she asked with some
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth made no answer. Instead, she pointed to the Monk's Cliff, where
      the grey stone of Far End gleamed in the sunlight against its dark
      background of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who lives there?" she asked. Sara's eyes followed the direction of her
      hand, and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I'm</i> going to live there," she answered. "That's Garth's home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh-h!" Elisabeth drew a quick breath. "It's a grim-looking place," she
      added, after a moment. "Rather lonely, I should imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth is fond of solitude," replied Sara simply, and she missed the
      swift, searching glance instantly leveled at her by the hyacinth eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length she took her departure, it was with a promise to return
      later on with Molly and Dr. Selwyn, so that they could all four walk out
      to Haven Woods together&mdash;since the doctor had undertaken to get
      through his morning's rounds in time to join the picnicking party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth accompanied her visitor to the head of the stairs, and then,
      returning to her room, stepped out on to the balcony once more. For a long
      time she stood leaning against the balustrade, gazing thoughtfully across
      the bay to that lonely house on the slope of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth Trent!" she murmured. "<i>Trent</i>! . . . And eyes with patches of
      blue in them! . . . Heavens! Can it possibly be? <i>Can</i> it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious quality in her voice, a blending of incredulity and
      distaste, and yet something that savoured of satisfaction&mdash;almost of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across her mental vision flitted a memory of just such eyes&mdash;gay,
      laughing, love-lit eyes, out of which the laughter had been suddenly
      dashed.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CUT DIRECT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a merry party which had gathered together in the shady heart of
      Haven Woods. The Selwyns, Sara and Elisabeth, Miles Herrick and the
      Lavender Lady were all there, and, in addition, there was a large and
      light-hearted contingent from Greenacres, where Audrey was entertaining a
      houseful of friends. Only Garth had not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young subalterns on leave and a couple of pretty American sisters, all
      of them staying at Greenacres, were making things hum, nobly seconded in
      their efforts by Miles Herrick, who had practically recovered from his
      sprained ankle and one of whose "good days" it chanced to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one seemed bubbling over with good-humour and high spirits, so that
      the dell re-echoed to the shouts of jolly laughter, while the birds,
      flitting nervously hither and thither, wondered what manner of creatures
      these were who had invaded their quiet sanctuary of the woods. And
      presently, when the whole party gathered round the white cloth, spread
      with every dainty that the inspired mind of Audrey's chef had been able to
      devise, and the popping corks began to punctuate the babble of chattering
      voices, they took wing and fled incontinently. They had heard similar
      sharp, explosive sounds before, and had noted them as being generally the
      harbingers of sudden death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's that wretched hermit of yours, Sara?" demanded Audrey gaily. "I
      told him we should lunch at one, and it's already a quarter-past. Ah!"&mdash;catching
      sight of a lean, supple figure advancing between the trees&mdash;"Here he
      is at last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout greeted Garth's approach, and the uproarious quartette composed of
      the two subalterns and the girls from New York City pounded joyously with
      their forks upon their plates, creating a perfect pandemonium of noise,
      Miles recklessly participating in the clamorous welcome, while the
      Lavender Lady fluttered her handkerchief, and Sara and Audrey both hurried
      forward to meet the late comer. In the general excitement nobody chanced
      to observe the effect which Trent's appearance had had upon one of the
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth had half-risen from the grassy bank on which she had been
      sitting, and her face was suddenly milk-white. Even her lips had lost
      their soft rose-colour, and were parted as if an exclamation of some kind
      had been only checked from passing them by sheer force of will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of her white face, her eyes, seeming so dark that they were almost
      violet, stared fixedly at Garth as he approached. Their expression was as
      masked, as enigmatical as ever, yet back of it there gleamed an odd light,
      and it was as though some curious menace lay hidden in its quiet,
      slumbrous fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little group composed of Audrey, Sara, and Garth had joined the main
      party now, and Garth was shaking eager, outstretched hands and laughingly
      tossing back the shower of chaff which greeted his tardy arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sara, laying her hand on his arm, steered him towards Elisabeth. Some
      one who had been standing a little in front of the latter, screening her
      from Trent's view, moved aside as they approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth, let me introduce you to Mrs. Durward."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile that would naturally have accompanied the words was arrested ere
      it dawned, and involuntarily Sara drew back before the instant, startling
      change in Garth's face. It had grown suddenly ashen, and his eyes were
      like those of a man who, walking in some pleasant place, finds all at
      once, that a bottomless abyss has opened at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full moment he and Elisabeth stared at each other in a silence so
      vital, so pregnant with some terrible significance, that it impacted upon
      the whole prevailing atmosphere of care-free jollity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden muteness descended on the party, the laughing voices trailing off
      into affrighted silence, and in the dumb stillness that followed Sara was
      vibrantly conscious of the hostile clash of wills between the man and
      woman who had, in a single instant, become the central figures of the
      little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Elisabeth's voice&mdash;that amazingly sweet voice of hers&mdash;broke
      the profound quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr.&mdash;Trent"&mdash;she hesitated delicately before the name&mdash;"and
      I have met before."
    </p>
    <p>
      And quite deliberately, with a proud, inflexible dignity, she turned her
      back upon him and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara never forgot the few moments that followed. She felt as though she
      were on the brink of some crisis in her life which had been slowly drawing
      nearer and nearer to her and was now acutely imminent, and instinctively
      she sought to gather all her energies together to meet it. What it might
      be she could not guess, but she was sure that this declared enmity between
      the man she loved and the woman who was her friend preluded some menace to
      her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sought Garth's in horror-stricken interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? What does she mean?" she demanded swiftly, in a breathless
      undertone, instinctively drawing aside from the rest of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She means mischief, probably," he replied. "Mrs. Durward is no friend of
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall explain," she exclaimed impetuously, and she swung aside,
      meaning to follow Elisabeth and demand an explanation of the insult. But
      Garth checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said decidedly. "Please do nothing&mdash;say nothing. For
      Audrey's sake we can't have a scene&mdash;here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's unpardonable&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as I say," he insisted. "Believe me, you will only make things worse
      if you interfere. I will make my apologies to Audrey and go. For my sake,
      Sara"&mdash;he looked at her intently&mdash;"go back and face it out.
      Behave as if nothing had happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Compelled, in spite of herself, by his insistence, Sara reluctantly
      assented and, leaving him, made her way slowly back to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disjointed buzz of talk sprayed up against her ears. Every one rushed
      into conversation, making valiant, if quite fruitless efforts to behave as
      though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, while, a little apart
      from the main group, Elisabeth stood alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Trent sought out his hostess, and together they moved away,
      pausing at last beneath the canopy of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No words can quite meet what has just occurred," he said formally. "I can
      only express my regret that my presence here should have occasioned such a
      <i>contretemps</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the whole brief scene had been utterly incomprehensible to her,
      Audrey intuitively sensed the bitter hurt underlying the harshly spoken
      words, and the outraged hostess was instantly submerged in the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry about it, Garth," she said gently, "although, of course, I
      don't understand Mrs. Durward's behaviour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very kind of you!" he replied, his voice softening. "But please
      do not visit your very natural indignation upon Mrs. Durward. I alone am
      to blame, I ought never to have renounced my role of hermit.
      Unfortunately"&mdash;with a brief smile of such sadness that Audrey felt
      her heart go out to him in a sudden rush of sympathy&mdash;"my mere
      presence is an abuse of my friends' hospitality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" she exclaimed quickly. "We are all glad to have you with us&mdash;we
      were so pleased when&mdash;when at last you came out of your shell, Garth"&mdash;with
      a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still the fact remains that I am outside the social pale. I had no
      business to thrust myself in amongst you. However&mdash;after this&mdash;you
      may rest assured that I shan't offend again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I decline to rest assured of anything of the kind," asserted Audrey with
      determination. "Don't be such a fool, Garth&mdash;or so unfair to your
      friends. Just because you chance to have met a women who, for some reason,
      chooses to cut you, doesn't alter our friendship for you in the very
      least. What Mrs. Durward may have against you I don't know&mdash;and I
      don't care either. <i>I</i> have nothing against you, and I don't propose
      to give any pal of mine the go-by because some one else happens to have
      quarreled with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent's eyes were curiously soft as he answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for that," he said earnestly. "All the same, I think you will
      have to make up your mind to allow your&mdash;friend, as you are good
      enough to call me, to go to the wall. You, and others like you, dragged
      him out, but, believe me, his place is not in the centre of the room.
      There are others besides Mrs. Durward who would give you the reason why,
      if you care to know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care to know it," responded Audrey firmly. "In fact, I should
      decline to recognize any reason against my calling you friend. I don't
      intend to let you go, nor will Miles, you'll find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Herrick! He's a good chap, isn't he?" said Trent a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all are&mdash;once you get to know us," returned Audrey, persistently
      cheerful. "And Sara&mdash;Sara won't let you go either, Garth."
    </p>
    <p>
      His sensitive, bitter mouth twisted suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't mind," he said quickly, "we won't talk about Sara. And I
      won't keep you any longer from your guests. It was&mdash;just like you&mdash;to
      take it as you have done, Audrey. And if, later on, you find yourself
      obliged to revise your opinion of me&mdash;I shall understand. And I shall
      not resent it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not very likely to do what you suggest."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with a curious expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it is only too probable," he rejoined simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrung her hand, and, turning, walked swiftly away through the wood,
      while Audrey retraced her footsteps in the direction of the dell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was feeling extremely annoyed at what she considered to be Mrs.
      Durward's hasty and inconsiderate action. It was unpardonable of any one
      thus to spoil the harmony of the day, she reflected indignantly, and then
      she looked up and met Elisabeth's misty, hyacinth eyes, full of a gentle,
      appealing regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Maynard, I must beg you to try and pardon me," she said, approaching
      with a charming gesture of apology. "I have no excuse to offer except that
      Mr. Trent is a man I&mdash;I cannot possibly meet." She paused and seemed
      to swallow with some difficulty, and of a sudden Audrey was conscious of a
      thrill of totally unexpected compassion. There was so evidently genuine
      pain and emotion behind the hesitating apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you should have been distressed," she replied kindly. "It has
      been a most unfortunate affair all round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth bestowed a grateful little smile upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will forgive me," she said, "I will say good-bye now. I am sure
      you will understand my withdrawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, you mustn't think of such a thing," cried Audrey hospitably,
      though within herself she could not but acknowledge that the suggestion
      was a timely one. "Please don't run away from us like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very kind of you, but really&mdash;if you will excuse me&mdash;I
      think I would prefer not to remain. I feel somewhat <i>bouleversee</i>.
      And I am so distressed to have been the unwitting cause of spoiling your
      charming party."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you would really rather go&mdash;&mdash;" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather," persisted Elisabeth with a gentle inflexibility of
      purpose. "Will you give a message to Sara for me?" Audrey nodded. "Ask her
      to come and see me to-morrow, and tell her that&mdash;that I will
      explain." Suddenly she stretched out an impulsive hand. "Oh, Mrs. Maynard!
      If you knew how much I dread explaining this matter to Sara! Perhaps,
      however"&mdash;her eyes took on a thoughtful expression&mdash;"Perhaps,
      however, it may not be necessary&mdash;perhaps it can be avoided."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of foreboding seemed to close round Audrey's heart, as she met the
      gaze of the beautiful, enigmatic eyes. What was it that Elisabeth intended
      to "explain" to Sara? Something connected with Garth Trent, of course, and
      it was impossible, in view of the attitude Elisabeth had assumed, to hope
      that it could be aught else than something to his detriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If an explanation can be avoided, Mrs. Durward," she said rather coldly,
      "I think it would be much better. The least said, the soonest mended, you
      know," she added, looking straight into the baffling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women, all at once antagonistic and suspicious of each other,
      shook hands formally, and Elisabeth took her way through the woods, while
      Audrey rejoined her neglected guests and used her best endeavours to
      convert an entertainment that threatened to become a failure into, at
      least, a qualified success. By dint of infinite tact, and the loyal
      cooperation of Miles Herrick, she somehow achieved it, and the majority of
      the picnickers enjoyed themselves immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Sara felt as though a shadow had crept out from some hidden place and
      cast its grey length across the path whereon she walked, while Miles and
      Audrey, discerning the shadow with the clear-sighted vision of friendship,
      were filled with apprehension for the woman whom they had both learned to
      love.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MIDNIGHT VISITOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Judson crossed the hall at Far End and, opening the front door, peered
      anxiously out into the moonlit night for the third time that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither he nor his wife could surmise what had become of their master. He
      had gone away, as they knew, with the intention of joining a picnic party
      in Haven Woods, but he had given no instructions that he wished the
      dinner-hour postponed, and now the beautiful little dinner which Mrs.
      Judson had prepared and cooked for her somewhat exigent employer had been
      entirely robbed of its pristine delicacy of flavour, since it had been
      "keeping hot" in the oven for at least two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming yet?" queried Mrs. Judson, as her husband returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a sign of 'im," he replied briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, the house door opened and closed with a bang, and
      Judson hastened upstairs to ascertain his master's wishes. When he again
      rejoined the wife of his bosom, his face wore a look of genuine concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something's happened," he announced solemnly. "Ten years have I been in
      Mr. Trent's service, and never, Maria, never have I seen him look as he do
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's he looking like, then?" demanded Mrs. Judson, pausing with a
      saucepan in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a man what's been in hell," replied her husband dramatically. "He's
      as white as that piece of paper"&mdash;pointing to the sheet of cooking
      paper with which Mrs. Judson had been conscientiously removing the grease
      from the chipped potatoes. "And his eyes look wild. He's been walking, too&mdash;must
      have walked twenty miles or thereabouts, I should think, for he seems dead
      beat and his boots are just a mask of mud. His coat's torn and splashed,
      as well&mdash;as if he'd pushed his way through bushes and all, without
      ever stopping to see where he was going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he'll be wanting his dinner," observed Mrs. Judson practically.
      "I'll dish it up&mdash;'tisn't what you might call actually spoiled as
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't have any. 'Judson,' he says to me, 'bring me a whisky-and-soda
      and some sandwiches. I don't want nothing else. And then you can lock up
      and go to bed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, bless the man, look alive and get the whisky-and-soda and a
      tray ready whiles I cut the sandwiches," exclaimed the excellent Mrs.
      Judson promptly, giving her bemused spouse a push in the direction of the
      pantry and herself bustling away to fetch a loaf of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are. But I was so took aback at the master's appearance, Maria,
      you could have knocked me down with a feather. I wonder if his young
      lady's given him his congy?" he added reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judson did not stay to discuss the question, but set about preparing
      the sandwiches, and a few minutes later Judson carried into Trent's own
      particular snuggery an attractive-looking little tray and placed it on a
      table at his master's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had not been far out in his reckoning when he opined that his
      master had walked "twenty miles or thereabouts." When he had quitted Haven
      Woods, Garth had started off, heedless of the direction he took, and,
      since then, he had been tramping, almost blindly, up hill and down dale,
      over hedges, through woods, along the shore, stumbling across the rocks,
      anywhere, anywhere in the world to get away from the maddening,
      devil-ridden thoughts which had pursued him since the brief meeting with a
      woman whose hyacinth eyes recalled the immeasurable anguish of years ago
      and threatened the joy which the future seemed to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was haggard. Heavy lines had graved themselves about his mouth,
      and beneath drawn brows his eyes glowed like sombre fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judson paused irresolutely beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I pour you out a whisky, sir?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent started. He had been oblivious of the man's entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'll do it myself&mdash;presently. Lock up and go to bed," he
      answered brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Judson still hesitated. There was an expression of affectionate
      solicitude on his usually wooden face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better have one at once, sir," he said persuasively. "And I think you'll
      find the chicken sandwiches very good, sir, if you'll excuse my mentioning
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment a faint, kindly smile chased away the look of intense
      weariness in Garth's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You transparent old fool, Judson!" he said indulgently. "You're like an
      old hen clucking round. Very well, make me a whisky, if you will, and give
      me one of those superlative sandwiches."
    </p>
    <p>
      Judson waited on him contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything more to-night, sir? Shall I close the window?" with a gesture
      towards the wide-open window near which his master sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth shook his head, and, when at last the manservant had reluctantly
      taken his departure, he remained for a long time sitting very still,
      staring out across the moon-washed garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he stirred restlessly. Glancing round the room, his eyes fell on
      his violin, lying upon the table with the bow beside it just as he had
      laid it down that morning after he had been improvising, in a fit of mad
      spirits, some variations on the theme of Mendelssohn's Wedding March.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the instrument and struck a few desultory chords. Then, tucking
      it more closely beneath his chin, he began to play&mdash;a broken, fitful
      melody of haunting sadness, tormented by despairing chords, swept hither
      and thither by rushing minor cadences&mdash;the very spirit of pain
      itself, wandering, ghost-like, in desert places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs Judson turned heavily in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just hark to 'im, Maria," he muttered uneasily. "He fair makes my flesh
      creep with that doggoned fiddle of his. 'Tis like a child crying in the
      dark. I wish he'd stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sad strains still went on, rising and falling, while Garth paced
      back and forth the length of the room and the candles flickered palely in
      the moonlight that poured in through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, across the lawn a figure flitted, noiseless as a shadow. It
      paused once, as though listening, then glided forward again, slowly
      drawing nearer and nearer until at last it halted on the threshold of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth, for the moment standing with his back towards the window, continued
      playing, oblivious of the quiet listener. Then, all at once, the feeling
      that he was no longer alone, that some one was sharing with him the
      solitude of the night, invaded his consciousness. He turned swiftly, and
      as his glance fell upon the silent figure standing at the open window, he
      slowly drew his violin from beneath his chin and remained staring at the
      apparition as though transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a woman who had thus intruded on his privacy. A scarf of black lace
      was twisted, hood-like, about her head, and beneath its fragile drapery
      was revealed the beautiful face and haunting, mysterious eyes of Elisabeth
      Durward. She had flung a long black cloak over her evening gown, and where
      it had fallen a little open at the throat her neck gleamed privet-white
      against its shadowy darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystical, transfiguring touch of the moon's soft light had eliminated
      all signs of maturity, investing her with an amazing look of youth, so
      that for an instant it seemed to Trent as though the years had rolled back
      and Elisabeth Eden, in all the incomparable beauty of her girlhood, stood
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her in utter silence, and the brooding eyes returned his gaze
      unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words burst from him at last in a low, tense whisper, and, as if the
      sound broke some spell that had been holding both the man and woman
      motionless, Elisabeth stepped across the threshold and came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent made a swift gesture&mdash;almost, it seemed, a gesture of aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you come here?" he demanded hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a little nearer, then paused, her hand resting on the table, and
      looked at him with a strange, questioning expression in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a poor welcome, Maurice," she observed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He winced sharply at the sound of the name by which she had addressed him,
      then, recovering himself, faced her with apparent composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no welcome for you," he said in measured tones. "Why should I
      have? All that was between us two . . . ended . . . half a life-time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she cried out. "No! Not all! There is still my son's happiness to be
      reckoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your son's happiness?" He stared at her amazedly. "What has your son's
      happiness to do with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything!" she answered. "Everything! Sara Tennant is the woman he
      loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you come here to blame me for the fact that she does not return
      his love?"&mdash;with an accent of ironical amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't blame you. But if it had not been for you she would have
      married him. They were engaged, and then"&mdash;her voice shook a little&mdash;"you
      came! You came&mdash;and robbed Tim of his happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent smiled sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An instance of the grinding of the mills of God," he said lightly. "You
      robbed me&mdash;you'll agree?&mdash;of something I valued. And now&mdash;inadvertently&mdash;I
      have robbed you in return of your son's happiness. It appears"&mdash;consideringly&mdash;"an
      unusually just dispensation of Providence. And the sins of the parents are
      visited on the child, as is the usual inscrutable custom of such
      dispensations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth seemed to disregard the bitter gibe his speech contained. She
      looked at him with steady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you&mdash;out of the way," she said deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" The indifferent, drawling tone was contradicted by the sudden
      dangerous light that gleamed in the hazel eyes. "You mean you want me&mdash;to
      pay&mdash;once more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away uneasily, flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it does amount to that," she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how would you suggest it should be done?" he inquired composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes came back to his face. There was an eager light in them, and when
      she spoke the words hurried from her lips in imperative demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it would be so easy, Maurice! You have only to convince Sara that you
      are not fit to marry her&mdash;or any woman, for that matter! Tell her
      what your reputation is&mdash;tell her why you can never show yourself
      amongst your fellow men, why you live here under an assumed name. She
      won't want to marry you when she knows these things, and Tim would have
      his chance to win her back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;let me quite understand you, Elisabeth"&mdash;Trent spoke
      with curious precision&mdash;"that I am to blacken myself in Sara's eyes,
      so that, discovering what a wolf in sheep's clothing I am, she will break
      off our engagement. That, I take it, is your suggestion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath his searching glance she faltered a moment. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered boldly. "That is it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a charming programme," he commented. "But it doesn't seem to me that
      you have considered Sara at all in the matter. It will hardly add to her
      happiness to find that she has given her heart to&mdash;what shall we
      say?"&mdash;smiling disagreeably&mdash;"to the wrong kind of man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of, of course, she will be upset, <i>disillusionnee</i>, for a time. She
      will suffer. But then we all have our share of suffering. Sara cannot hope
      to be exempt. And afterwards&mdash;afterwards"&mdash;her eyes shining&mdash;"she
      will be happy. She and Tim will be happy together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you are prepared to cause all this suffering, Sara's and mine&mdash;though
      I suppose"&mdash;with a bitter inflection&mdash;"that last hardly counts
      with you!&mdash;in order to secure Tim's happiness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," significantly, "I am prepared&mdash;to do anything to secure that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent stared at her in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you <i>no</i> conscience?" he asked at last. "Have you never had
      any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a little piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand," she muttered. "You don't understand. I'm his
      mother. And I want him to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," he said, "that I cannot help you. But I'm afraid Tim's
      happiness isn't going to be purchased at my expense. I haven't the least
      intention of blackening myself in the eyes of the woman I love for the
      sake of Tim&mdash;or of twenty Tims. Please understand that, once and for
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gestured as though to indicated that she should precede him to the
      window by which she had entered. But she made no movement to go. Instead
      she flung back her cloak as though it were stifling her, and caught him
      impetuously by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maurice! Maurice! For God's sake, listen to me!" Her voice was suddenly
      shaken with passionate entreaty. "Use some other method, then! Break with
      her some other way! If you only knew how I hate to ask you this&mdash;I
      who have already brought only sorrow and trouble into your life! But Tim&mdash;my
      son&mdash;he must come first!" She pressed a little closer to him, lifting
      her face imploringly. "Maurice, you loved me once&mdash;for the sake of
      that love, grant me my boy's happiness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly, inexorably, he disengaged himself from the eager clasp of her
      hand. Her beautiful, agonized face, the vehement supplication of her
      voice, moved him not a jot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making a poor argument," he said coldly. "You are making your
      request in the name of a love that died three-and-twenty years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean"&mdash;she stared at him&mdash;"that you have not cared&mdash;at
      all&mdash;since?" She spoke incredulously. Then, suddenly, she laughed.
      "And I&mdash;what a fool I was!&mdash;I used to grieve&mdash;often&mdash;thinking
      how you must be suffering!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled wryly as at some bitter memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I did," he responded shortly. "Death has its pains&mdash;even the
      death of first love. My love for you died hard, Elisabeth&mdash;but it
      died. You killed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will not do what I ask for the sake of the love you&mdash;once&mdash;gave
      me?" There was a desperate appeal in her low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. "No," he said, "I will not."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you drive me into doing what I hate to do!" she exclaimed fiercely.
      She was silent for a moment, standing with bowed head, her mouth working
      painfully. Then, drawing herself up, she faced him again. There was
      something in the lithe, swift movement that recalled a panther gathering
      itself together for its spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!" she said. "If you will not find some means of breaking off your
      engagement with Sara, then I shall tell her the whole story&mdash;tell her
      what manner of man it is she proposes to make her husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a supreme challenge in her tones, and she waited for his answer
      defiantly&mdash;her head flung back, her whole body braced, as it were, to
      resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed, Trent drew away from her&mdash;slowly,
      repugnantly, as though from something monstrous and unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't&mdash;you <i>couldn't</i> do such a thing!" he exclaimed in
      low, appalled tones of unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could!" she asserted, though her face whitened and her eyes flinched
      beneath his contemptuous gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it would be a vile thing to do," he pursued, still with that accent
      of incredulous abhorrence. "Doubly vile for <i>you</i> to do this thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I don't know that&mdash;don't realize it?" she answered
      desperately. "You can say nothing that could make me think it worse than I
      do already. It would be the basest action of which any woman could be
      guilty. I recognize that. And yet"&mdash;she thrust her face, pinched and
      strained-looking, into his&mdash;"<i>and yet I shall do it</i>. I'd take
      that sin&mdash;or any other&mdash;on my conscience for the sake of Tim."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent turned away from her with a gesture of defeat, and for a moment or
      two he paced silently backwards and forwards, while she watched him with
      burning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you realize what it means?" she went on urgently. "You have no way
      out. You can't deny the truth of what I have to tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he acknowledged harshly. "As you say, I cannot deny it. No one knows
      that better than yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he turned to her, and his face was that of a man in uttermost
      anguish of soul. Beads of moisture rimmed his drawn mouth, and when he
      spoke his voice was husky and uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I suffered enough&mdash;paid enough?" he burst out passionately.
      "You've had your pound of flesh. For God's sake, be satisfied with that!
      Leave&mdash;Garth Trent&mdash;to build up what is left of his life in
      peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The roughened, tortured tones seemed to unnerve her. For a moment she hid
      her face in her hands, shuddering, and when she raised it again the tears
      were running down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't&mdash;I can't!" she whispered brokenly. "I wish I could . . . you
      were good to me once. Oh! Maurice, I'm not a bad woman, not a wicked woman
      . . . but I've my son to think of . . . his happiness." She paused,
      mastering, with an effort, the emotion that threatened to engulf her.
      "Nothing else counts&mdash;<i>nothing</i>! If you go to the wall, Tim
      wins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I'm to pay&mdash;first for your happiness, and now, more than twenty
      years later, for your son's. You don't ask&mdash;very much&mdash;of a man,
      Elisabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had himself in hand now. The momentary weakness which had wrenched that
      brief, anguished appeal from his lips was past, and the dry scorn of his
      voice cut like a lash, stinging her into hostility once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have given you the chance to break with Sara yourself&mdash;on any
      pretext you choose to invent," she said hardly. "You've refused&mdash;"
      She hesitated. "You do&mdash;still refuse, Maurice?" Again the note of
      pleading, of appeal in her voice. It was as though she begged of him to
      spare them both the consequences of that refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must take the only other way that remains. You know what that will
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped, and, picking up her cloak which had fallen to the floor, held
      it for her to put on. He had completely regained his customary
      indifference of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we need not prolong this interview, then," he said composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth drew the cloak around her and moved slowly towards the window.
      Outside, the tranquil moonlight still flooded the garden, the peaceful
      quiet of the night remained all undisturbed by the fierce conflict of
      human wills and passions that had spent itself so uselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing more"&mdash;she paused on the threshold as Trent spoke again&mdash;"You
      will not blacken the name of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>No</i>!" It was as though she had struck the unuttered word from his
      lips. "Did you think I should? Those who bear it have suffered enough.
      There's no need to drag it through the mire a second time."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick movement she drew her cloak more closely about her, and
      stepped out into the garden. For a moment Garth watched her crossing the
      lawns, a slender, upright, swiftly moving shadow. Then a clump of bushes,
      thrusting its wall of darkness into the silver sea of moonlight, hid her
      from his sight, and he turned back into the room. Stumblingly he made his
      way to the chimney-piece, and, resting his arms upon it, hid his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he remained thus, motionless, while the grandfather clock
      in the corner ticked away indifferently, and one by one the candles
      guttered down and went out in little pools of grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he raised his face, it looked almost ghastly in the
      moonlight, so lined and haggard was it, and its sternly set expression was
      that of a man who had schooled himself to endure the supreme ill that
      destiny may hold in store.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      J'ACCUSE!
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Of course, there could be but one ending to it all. The man to whom you
      have promised yourself&mdash;Garth Trent&mdash;was court-martialled and
      cashiered."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she finished speaking, Elisabeth's hands, which had been tightly locked
      together upon her knee, relaxed and fell stiffly apart, cramped with the
      intensity of their convulsive pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sat silent, staring with unseeing eyes across the familiar bay to
      that house on the cliff where lived the man whose past history&mdash;that
      history he had guarded so strenuously and completely from the ears of
      their little world&mdash;had just been revealed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentally she was envisioning the whole scene of the story which
      hesitatingly&mdash;almost unwilling, it seemed&mdash;Elisabeth had poured
      out. She could see the lonely fort on the Indian Frontier, sparsely held
      by its indomitable little band of British soldiers, and ringed about on
      every side by the hill tribes who had so suddenly and unexpectedly risen
      in open rebellion. In imagination she could sense the hideous tension as
      day succeeded day and each dawning brought no sign of the longed-for
      relief forces. Indeed, it was not even known if the messengers sent by the
      officer in command had got safely through to the distant garrison to
      deliver his urgent message asking succour. And each evening found those
      who were besieged within the fort with diminished rations, and diminished
      hope, and with one or more dead to mark the enemy's unceasing vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then had come the mysterious apparent withdrawal of the tribesmen. For
      hours no sign of the enemy had been seen, nor a single fugitive shot fired
      when one or other of the besieged had risked themselves at an unguarded
      aperture, whereas, until that morning, for a man to show himself, even for
      a moment, had been to court almost certain death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the rebels have received word of the approach of a relieving force,
      whispers of a punitive expedition on its way, and so stolen stealthily,
      discreetly away in the silence of the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      The hearts of the little beleaguered force rose high with hope, but again
      morning drew to evening without bringing sight or sound of succour. Only
      the enemy persisted in that strange, unbroken silence, and, at last, a
      hasty council of war was held within the fort, and Garth Trent, together
      with a handful of men, had been detailed to make a reconnaissance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could picture the little party stealing out on their dangerous errand&mdash;dangerous,
      indeed, if the withdrawal of the tribesmen were but a bluff, a scheme
      devised to lull the besieged into a false sense of security in order to
      attack them later at a greater disadvantage. And then&mdash;the sudden
      spit of a rifle, a ringing fusillade of shots in the dense darkness! The
      reconnaissance party had run into an ambuscade!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could guess well the frayed nerves, the low vitality of men who were
      short of food, short of sleep, and worn with incessant watching night and
      day. But&mdash;Could it be possible that Englishmen had flinched at the
      crucial moment&mdash;lost their nerve and fled in wild disorder?
      Englishmen&mdash;who held the sacred trust of empire in their hands&mdash;to
      show the white feather to a horde of rebel natives! It was inconceivable!
      Sara, reared in the great tradition by that gallant gentleman, Patrick
      Lovell, refused to credit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long, shuddering breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth looked at her with a pitying comprehension of the blow she had
      just dealt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid," she said gently, almost deprecatingly, "that there is no
      questioning the finding of the court-martial. Garth must have lost his
      head at the unexpectedness of the attack. And panic is a curious,
      unaccountable kind of thing, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it," reiterated Sara stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth bent forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said, "there is no possibility of doubt. Garth was wounded;
      they brought him in afterwards&mdash;<i>shot in the back</i>! . . . Oh! It
      was all a horrible business! And the most wretched part of it all was that
      in reality they were only a few stray tribesmen whom our men had
      encountered. Perhaps Garth thought they were outnumbered&mdash;I don't
      know. But anyway, coming on the top of all that had gone before, the
      surprise attack in the darkness broke his nerve completely. He didn't even
      attempt to make a stand. He simply gave way. What followed was just a
      headlong scramble as to who could save his skin first! I shall never
      forget Garth's return after&mdash;after the court-martial." She shuddered
      a little at the memory. "I&mdash;I was engaged to him at the time, Sara,
      and I had no choice but to break it off. Garth was cashiered&mdash;disgraced&mdash;done
      for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's drooping figure suddenly straightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You&mdash;you</i>&mdash;were engaged to Garth?" she said in a queer,
      high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes"&mdash;simply. "I had promised to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was silent for a long moment. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He never told me," she muttered. "He never told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? It was hardly likely he would, was it? He couldn't tell you that
      without telling you&mdash;the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara made no answer. She felt stunned&mdash;beaten into helpless silence
      by the quiet, inexorable voice that, bit by bit, minute by minute, had
      drawn aside the veil of ignorance and revealed the dry bones and
      rottenness that lay hidden behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it!" she had cried in a futile effort to convince herself
      by the sheer reiteration of denial. But she <i>did</i> believe it,
      nevertheless. The whole miserable story tallied too accurately with the
      bitterly significant remarks that Garth himself had let fall from time to
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day of the dog-fight, for instance. What was it he had said? "<i>A
      certain amount of allowance must be made for nerves</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      And again: "<i>I suppose no man can be dead sure of himself&mdash;always</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The implication was too horribly clear to be evaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told her, moreover, that he was a man who had made a shipwreck of
      his life, that in a moment of folly&mdash;a moment of funk she knew now to
      be the veridical description!&mdash;he had flung away the whole chances of
      his life. The man whom she had loved, and, in her love, idealized, had
      proved himself, when the test came, that most despicable of things, a
      coward! The pain of realization was almost unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, across the utter desolation of the moment there shot a single
      ray of hope. She turned triumphantly to Elisabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if it were true that Garth&mdash;had shown cowardice, why was he not
      shot? They shoot men for cowardice"&mdash;grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are many excuses to be made for him, Sara," replied Elisabeth
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuses! For cowardice!" The low-spoken words were icy with a biting
      contempt. "I'm afraid I could not find them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The court-martial did, nevertheless. At the trial, the 'prisoner's
      friend'&mdash;in this instance, Garth's colonel, who was very fond of him
      and had always thought very highly of him&mdash;pleaded extenuating
      circumstances. Garth's youth, his previous good record, the conditions of
      the moment&mdash;the continuous mental and physical strain of the days
      preceding his sudden loss of nerve&mdash;all these things were urged by
      the 'prisoner's friend,' and the sentence was commuted to one of
      cashiering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have been better if he had been shot," said Sara dully. Then
      suddenly she clapped both hands to her mouth. "Ah&mdash;h! What am I
      saying? Garth! . . . Garth! . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stumbled to her feet, her white, ravaged face turned for a moment
      yearningly towards Far End, where it stood bathed in the mocking morning
      sunlight. Then she spun half-round, groping for support, and fell in a
      crumpled heap on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sara came to herself again, she was lying on the bed in Elisabeth's
      room at the hotel. Some one had drawn the blinds, shutting out the crude
      glare of the sunlight, and in the semi-darkness she could feel soft hands
      about her, bathing her face with something fragrantly cool and refreshing.
      She opened her eyes and looked up to find Elisabeth's face bent over her&mdash;unspeakably
      kind and tender, like that of some Madonna brooding above her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you feeling better?" The sweet, familiar voice roused her to the
      realization of what had happened. It was the same voice that, before
      unconsciousness had wrapped her in its merciful oblivion, had been pouring
      into her ears an unbelievably hideous story&mdash;a nightmare tale of what
      had happened at some far distant Indian outpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of the story seemed to be all jumbled confusedly together in
      Sara's mind, but, as gradually full consciousness returned, they began to
      sort themselves and fall into their rightful places, and all at once, with
      a swift and horrible contraction of her heart, the truth knocked at the
      door of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled up on to her elbow, her eyes frantically appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elisabeth, was it true? Was it&mdash;all true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Elisabeth's hand closed round hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you must try and face it. And"&mdash;her voice shook a little&mdash;"you
      must try and forgive me for telling you. But I couldn't let you marry
      Garth Trent in ignorance, could I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is true? Garth was court-martialled and&mdash;and cashiered?"
      Sara sank back against her pillows. Still, deep within her, there
      flickered a faint spark of hope. Against all reason, against all common
      sense the faith that was within her fought against accepting the bitter
      knowledge that Garth was guilty of what was in her eyes the one
      unpardonable sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unpardonable! The word started a new and overwhelming train of thought.
      She remembered that she had told Garth she did not care what sin he had
      been guilty of, had forced him to believe that nothing could make any
      difference to her love for him, to her willingness to become his wife, and
      share his burden. Yet now, now that the hidden thing in his life had been
      revealed to her, she found herself shrinking from it in utter loathing!
      Her promises of faith and loyalty were already crumbling under the strain
      of her knowledge of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flinched from the recognition of the fact, seeking miserably to
      palliate and excuse it. When she had given Garth that impetuous assurance
      of her confidence, she had not, in her crudest imaginings, dreamed of
      anything so hideous and ignoble as the actual truth had proved to be.
      Vaguely, she had deemed him outcast for some big, reckless sin that by the
      splendour of its recklessness almost earned its own forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And instead&mdash;<i>this</i>! This drab-hued, pitiful weakness for which
      she could find no pardon in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the turmoil of her thoughts she became conscious that Elisabeth
      was stooping over her, answering her wild incredulous questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is true," she was saying steadily. "He was court-martialled and
      cashiered. But, if you still doubt it, ask him yourself, Sara."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's hands clenched themselves. Her eyes were feverishly brilliant in
      her white, shrunken face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll ask him myself." She panted a little. "You must be wrong&mdash;there
      must be some horrible mistake somewhere. I've been mad&mdash;mad to
      believe it for a single moment." She slipped from the bed to her feet, and
      stood confronting Elisabeth with a kind of desperate defiance. "Do you
      hear what I say?" she said loudly. "I don't believe it. I will never
      believe it till Garth himself tells me that it is true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear"&mdash;Elisabeth shrank away a little, but her eyes were kind
      and infinitely pitying. Sara felt frightened of the pitying kindness in
      those eyes&mdash;its rejection of Garth's innocence was so much stronger
      than any asseveration of mere words. Vaguely she heard Elisabeth's patient
      voice: "I think you are right. Ask him yourself&mdash;but, Sara, he will
      not be able to deny it."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RED RUIN
    </h3>
    <p>
      "You sent for me, and I am here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The brusque, curt speech sounded a knell to the faint hope which Sara had
      been tending whilst she waited for Garth's coming. His voice, the dogged
      expression of his face, the chill, brief manner, each held its grievous
      message for the woman who had learned to recognize the signs of mental
      stress in the man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I sent for you," she said. "I&mdash;I&mdash;Garth, I have seen
      Elisabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" Just the one brief monosyllable in response, uttered with a
      slightly questioning inflection. Nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara twisted her hands together. There was something unapproachable about
      Garth as he stood there&mdash;quiet, inflexible, waiting to hear what she
      had to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort she began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has told me of something&mdash;something that happened to you, in the
      past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? Quite a great deal happened&mdash;in my past. What was it, in
      particular, that she told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mocking quality in his tones stung her into open accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She told me that you had been court-martialled and cashiered from the
      Army&mdash;for cowardice." The words came slowly, succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;h!" He drew his breath sharply, and a grey shadow seemed to
      spread itself over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara waited&mdash;waited with an intensity of longing that was well-nigh
      unendurable&mdash;for either the indignant denial or the easy, mirthful
      scorn wherewith an innocent man might be expected to answer such a charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there came neither of these. Only silence&mdash;an endless, agonizing
      silence, while Garth stood utterly motionless, looking at her, his face
      slowly greying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to interpret the expression of his eyes. There was
      neither anger, nor horror, nor pleading in their cool indomitable stare,
      but only a hard, bright impenetrability, shuttering the soul behind it
      from the aching gaze of the woman who waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that silence, Sara's flickering hope that the accusation might prove
      false went out in blinding darkness. She <i>knew</i>, now&mdash;knew it as
      certainly as though Garth had answered her&mdash;that he was unable to
      deny it. Still, she would brace herself to hear it&mdash;to endure the
      ultimate anguish of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true?" she questioned him. "Is it true that you were&mdash;cashiered
      for cowardice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said. "It is true." His voice was altogether passionless, but
      something had come into his face, into his whole attitude, which denied
      the calm passivity of his reply. The soul of the man&mdash;a soul in
      ineffable extremity of suffering&mdash;was struggling for expression,
      striving against the rigid bonds of the motionless body in which his iron
      will constrained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara could sense it&mdash;a tormented flame shut in a casing of steel&mdash;and
      she was swept by a torrent of uttermost pity and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth! Garth! But there must have been some explanation! . . . You
      weren't in your right senses at the moment. Ah! Tell me&mdash;&mdash;" She
      broke off, her voice failing her, her arms outflung in a passion of
      entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she leaned towards him, a tremor seemed to run through his entire body&mdash;the
      tremor of leaping muscles straining against the leash. His hands clenched
      slowly, the nails biting into the bruised flesh. Then he spoke, and his
      voice was ringing and assured&mdash;arrogantly so. The tortured soul
      within him had been beaten back once more into its prison-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was quite in my right senses&mdash;that night on the Frontier&mdash;never
      more so, believe me"&mdash;and his lips twisted in a curious, enigmatical
      smile. "And as far as explanations&mdash;excuses&mdash;are concerned, the
      court-martial made all that were possible. I&mdash;I was not shot, you
      see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something outrageous in the open derision of the last words. He
      flung them at her&mdash;as though taunting, gibing at the impulse to
      compassion which had swayed her, sending her tremulously towards him with
      imploring, outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The quality of mercy was not strained in the least," he continued. "It
      fell around me like the proverbial gentle rain. I've quite a lot to be
      thankful for, don't you think?"&mdash;brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't know what to think!" she burst out. "That you&mdash;<i>you</i>
      should fall so low&mdash;so shamefully low."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man will do a good deal to preserve a whole skin, you know," he
      suggested hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you speak like that?" she demanded in sharpened tones. "Do you
      want me to think worse of you than I do already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step towards her and stood looking down at her with those
      bright, hard eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do," he said decidedly. "I want you to think as badly of me as you
      possibly can. I want you to realize just what sort of a blackguard you had
      promised to marry, and when you've got that really clear in your mind,
      you'll be able to forget all about me and marry some cheerful young fool
      who hasn't been kicked out of the Army."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as I live I shall never&mdash;be able&mdash;to forget that I
      loved&mdash;a coward." The words came haltingly from her lips. Then
      suddenly her shaking hands went up to her face, as though to shut him from
      her sight, and a dry, choking sob tore its way through her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a swift stride towards her, then checked himself and stood
      motionless once more, in the utter quiescence of deliberately arrested
      movement. Only his hands, hanging stiffly at his sides, opened and shut
      convulsively, and his eyes should have been hidden. God never meant any
      man's eyes to wear that look of unspeakable torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last Sara withdrew her hands and looked at him again, his face was
      set like a mask, the lips drawn back a little from the teeth in a way that
      suggested a dumb animal in pain. But she was so hurt herself that she
      failed to recognize his infinitely greater hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think&mdash;I think I hate you," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His taut muscles seemed to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you do," he said steadily. "It will be better so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the quiet acceptance of his tone moved her to a softer, more
      wistful emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it had been anything&mdash;anything but that, Garth, I think I could
      have borne it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a depth of appeal in the low-spoken words. But he ignored it,
      opposing a reckless indifference to her softened mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's just as well it wasn't 'anything but that.' Otherwise"&mdash;sardonically&mdash;"you
      might have felt constrained to abide by your rash promise to marry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes flashed over her face, mocking, deriding. He had struck where she
      was most vulnerable, accusing where her innate honesty of soul admitted
      she had no defence, and she winced away from the speech almost as though
      it had been a blow upon her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true she had given her promise blindly, in ignorance of the facts,
      but that could not absolve her. It was not Garth who had forced the
      promise from her. It was she who had impetuously offered it, never
      conceiving such a possibility as that he might be guilty of the one sin
      for which, in her eyes, there could be no palliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," she said unevenly. "I know. You have the right to remind me of
      my promise. I&mdash;I blame myself. It's horrible&mdash;to break one's
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment, standing with bent head, her instinct to be fair,
      to play the game, combating the revulsion of feeling with which the
      knowledge of Garth's act of cowardice had filled her. When she looked up
      again there was a curious intensity in her expression, wanly decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marriage for us&mdash;now&mdash;could never mean anything but misery."
      The effort in her voice was palpable. It was as though she were forcing
      herself to utter words from which her inmost being recoiled. "But I gave
      you my promise, and if&mdash;if you choose to hold me to it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't choose!" He broke in harshly. "You may spare yourself any anxiety
      on that score. You are free&mdash;as free as though we had never met. I'm
      quite ready to bow to your decision that I'm not fit to marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little caught breath of unutterable relief fluttered between her lips.
      If he heard it, he made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now"&mdash;he turned as though to leave her&mdash;"I think that's all
      that need be said between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not all"&mdash;in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Is there more still?" Again his voice held an insolent irony that
      lashed her like a whip. "Haven't you yet plumbed the full depths of my
      iniquity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. There is still one further thing. You said you loved me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did&mdash;I do still, if such as I may aspire to so lofty an emotion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a lie. Even"&mdash;her voice broke&mdash;"even in that you
      deceived me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though the tremulously uttered words pierced through his
      armour of sneering cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, in that, at least, I was honest with you." The bitter note of mockery
      that had rung through all his former speech was suddenly absent&mdash;muted,
      crushed out, and the quiet, steadfast utterance carried conviction even in
      Sara's reeling faith, shaking her to the very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But . . . Elisabeth? . . . You loved her once. And love&mdash;can't die,
      Garth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said gravely. "Love can't die. But what I felt for Elisabeth was
      not love&mdash;not love as you and I understand it. It was the mad passion
      of a boy for an extraordinarily beautiful woman. She was an ideal&mdash;I
      invested her with all the qualities and spiritual graces that her beauty
      seemed to promise. But the Elisabeth I loved&mdash;didn't exist." He drew
      nearer her and, laying his hands on her shoulders, looked down at her with
      eyes that seemed to burn their way into the inmost depths of her being.
      "Whatever you may think of me, however low I may have fallen in your
      sight, believe me in this&mdash;that I have loved you and shall always
      love you, utterly and entirely, with my whole soul and body. It has not
      been an easy love&mdash;I fought against it with all my strength, knowing
      that it could only carry pain and suffering in its train for both of us.
      But it conquered me. And when you came to me that day, so courageously,
      holding out your hands, claiming the love that was unalterably yours&mdash;when
      you came to me like that, a little hurt and wounded because I had been so
      slow to speak my love&mdash;I yielded! Before God, Sara! I had been either
      more or less than a man had I resisted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The grip of his hands upon her shoulders tightened until it was actual
      pain, and she winced under it, shrinking away from him. He released her
      instantly, and she stood silently beside him, battling against the longing
      to respond to that deep, abiding love which neither now, nor ever again in
      life, would she be able to doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Garth loved her, wholly and completely, was an incontrovertible fact.
      She no longer felt the least lingering mistrust, nor even any prick of
      jealousy that he had once loved before. That boyish passion of the senses
      for Elisabeth was not comparable with this love which was the maturer
      growth of his manhood&mdash;a love that could only know fulfillment in the
      mystic union of body, soul, and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this merely served to deepen the poignancy of the impending parting&mdash;for
      that she and Garth must part she recognized as inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loving each other as men and women love but once in a lifetime, their love
      was destined to be for ever unconsummated. They were as irrevocably
      divided as though the seas of the entire world ran between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearily, in the flat, level tones of one who realizes that all hope is at
      an end, she stumbled through the few broken phrases which cancelled the
      whole happiness of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all seems so useless, doesn't it&mdash;your love and mine? . . .
      You've killed something that I felt for you&mdash;I don't quite know what
      to call it&mdash;respect, I suppose, only that sounds silly, because it
      was much more than that. I wish&mdash;I wish I didn't love you still. But
      perhaps that, too, will die in time. You see, you're not the man I thought
      I cared for. You're&mdash;you're something I'm <i>ashamed</i> to love&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough!" he interrupted unsteadily. "Leave it at that. You won't
      beat it if you try till doomsday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pain in his voice pierced her to the heart, and she made an impulsive
      step towards him, shocked into quick remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth . . . I didn't mean it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you meant it," he said. "Don't imagine that I'm blaming you. I'm
      not. You've found me out, that's all. And having discovered exactly how
      contemptible a person I am, you&mdash;very properly&mdash;send me away."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel, giving her no time to reply, and a moment later she
      was alone. Then came the clang of the house door as it closed behind him.
      To Sara, it sounded like the closing of a door between two worlds&mdash;between
      the glowing past and the grey and empty future.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DIVERS OPINIONS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The consternation created at Sunnyside by the breaking off of Sara's
      engagement had spent itself at last. Selwyn had said but little, only his
      saint's eyes held the wondering, hurt look that the inexplicable sins of
      humanity always had the power to bring into them. Characteristically, he
      hated the sin but overflowed in sympathy for the sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor devil!" he said, when the whole story of Trent's transgression and
      its consequences had been revealed to him. "What a ghastly stone to hang
      round a man's neck for the term of his natural life! If they'd shot him,
      it would have been more merciful! That would at least have limited the
      suffering," he went on, taking Sara's hand and holding it in his strong,
      kindly one a moment. "Poor little comrade! Oh, my dear"&mdash;as she
      shrank instinctively&mdash;"I'm not going to talk about it&mdash;I know
      you'd rather not. Condolence platitudes were never in my line. But my
      pal's troubles are mine&mdash;just as she once made mine hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Crab's opinions were enunciated without fear or favour, and, in
      defiance of public opinion, she took her stand on the side of the sinner
      and maintained it unwaveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Miss Sara," she affirmed, "unless you've proof as strong as 'Oly
      Writ, as they say, I'd believe naught against Mr. Trent. Bluff and 'ard he
      may be in 'is manner, but after the way he conducted himself the night
      Miss Molly ran away, I'll never think no ill of 'im, not if it was ever
      so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara smiled drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could feel as you do, Jane dear. But&mdash;Mrs. Durward <i>knows</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Durward! Huh! One of them tigris women I calls 'er," retorted Jane,
      who had formed her opinion with lightning rapidity when Elisabeth made a
      farewell visit to Sunnyside before leaving Monkshaven. "Not but what you
      can't help liking her, neither," went on Jane judicially. "There's
      something good in the woman, for all she looks at you like a cat who
      thinks you're after stealing her kittens. But there! As the doctor&mdash;bless
      the man!&mdash;always says, there's good in everybody if so be you'll look
      for it. Only I'd as lief think that Mrs. Durward was somehow scared-like&mdash;too
      almighty scared to be her natchral self, savin' now and again when she
      forgets."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. Selwyn, the breaking off of Sara's engagement, and the manner of
      it, signified very little. She watched the panorama of other people's
      lives unfold with considerably less sympathetic concern than that with
      which one follows the ups and downs that befall the characters in a cinema
      drama, since they were altogether outside the radius of that central topic
      of unfailing interest&mdash;herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way in which recent events impinged upon her life was in so far
      as the rupture of Sara's engagement would probably mean the indefinite
      prolongation of her stay at Sunnyside, which would otherwise have ended
      with her marriage. And this, from Mrs. Selwyn's egotistical point of view,
      was all to the good, since Sara had acquired a pleasant habit of making
      herself both useful and entertaining to the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly's emotions carried her to the other extreme of the compass. Since
      the night when she had realized that she had narrowly missed making entire
      shipwreck of her life, thanks to the evil genius of Lester Kent, her
      character seemed to have undergone a change&mdash;to have deepened and
      expanded. She was no longer so buoyantly superficial in her envisagement
      of life, and the big things reacted on her in a way which would previously
      have been impossible. Formerly, their significance would have passed her
      by, and she would have floated airily along, unconscious of their piercing
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side with this increase of vision, there had developed a very deep
      and sincere affection for both Garth and Sara based, probably, in its
      inception, on her realization that whatever of good, whatever of
      happiness, life might hold for her, she would owe it fundamentally to the
      two who had so determinedly kept her heedless feet from straying into that
      desert from which there is no returning to the pleasant paths of
      righteousness. A censorious world sees carefully to that, for ever barring
      out the sinner&mdash;of the weaker sex&mdash;from inheriting the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that to this new and awakened Molly the abrupt termination of Sara's
      engagement came as something almost too overwhelming to be borne. She did
      not see how Sara <i>could</i> bear it, and to her youthful mind,
      mercifully unwitting that grief is one of the world's commonplaces, Sara
      was henceforth haloed with sorrow, set specially apart by the tragic
      circumstances which had enveloped her. Unconsciously she lowered her voice
      when speaking to her, infusing a certain specific sympathy into every
      small action she performed for her, shrank from troubling her in any way,
      and altogether, in her youth and inexperience, behaved rather as though
      she were in a house of mourning, where the candles yet burned in the
      chamber of death and the blinds shut out the light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Sara rebelled, although compassionately aware of Molly's excellent
      intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly, my angel, if you persist in treating me as though I had just lost
      the whole of my relatives in an earthquake or a wreck at sea, I shall
      explode. I've had a bad knock, but I don't want it continually rubbing
      into me. The world will go on&mdash;even although my engagement is broken
      off. And <i>I'm</i> going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bravely spoken, and though Sara was inwardly conscious that in the
      last words the spirit, for the moment, outdistanced the flesh, it served
      to dissipate the rather strained atmosphere which had prevailed at
      Sunnyside since the rupture of her engagement had become common knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, figuratively speaking, the blinds were drawn up and life resumed its
      normal aspect once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had fallen to the lot of Audrey Maynard to carry the ill-tidings to
      Rose Cottage. Sara had asked her to acquaint their little circle with the
      altered condition of affairs, and Audrey had readily undertaken to perform
      this service, eager to do anything that might spare Sara some of the
      inevitable pinpricks which attend even the big tragedies of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole affair is incomprehensible to me," said Audrey at last, as she
      rose preparatory to taking her departure. There seemed no object in
      lingering to discuss so painful a topic. "It's&mdash;oh! It's
      heart-breaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Livinia departed hastily to do a little weep in the seclusion of her
      room upstairs. She hardly concerned herself with the enormity of Garth's
      offence. She was old, and she saw only romance shattered into fragments,
      youth despoiled of its heritage, love crucified. Moreover, the Lavender
      Lady had never been censorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your opinion, Miles?" asked Audrey, when she had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick had been rather silent, his brown eyes meditative. Now he looked
      up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the funking part of it? As I wasn't on the spot when the affair
      took place, I haven't the least right to venture an opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why not. You can't get behind the verdict of the
      court-martial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trials have been known where justice went awry," said Miles quietly.
      "There was a trial where Pilate was judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you doubt the verdict?"&mdash;eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I was not meaning quite that in this case. But, because the law says
      a man is a blackguard, when I'd stake my life he's nothing of the kind, it
      doesn't alter my opinion one hair's-breadth. The verdict may have been&mdash;probably,
      almost certainly, <i>was</i>&mdash;the only verdict that could be given to
      meet the facts of the case. But still, it is possible that it was not a
      just verdict&mdash;labelling as a coward for all time a man who may have
      had one bad moment when his nerves played him false. There are other men
      who have had their moment of funk, but, as the matter never came under the
      official eyes, they have made good since&mdash;ended up as V.C.'s, some of
      'em. Facts are often very foolish things, to my mind. Motives, and
      circumstances, even conditions of physical health, are bound to play as
      big a part as facts, if you're going to administer pure justice. But the
      army can't consider the super-administration of justice"&mdash;smiling.
      "Discipline must be maintained and examples made. Only&mdash;sometimes&mdash;it's
      damn bad luck on the example."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unusually long speech for Miles to have been guilty of, and
      Audrey stood looking at him in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miles, you're rather a dear, you know. I believe you're almost as
      strongly on Garth's side as Jane Crab."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Jane?" And Herrick smiled. "She's a good old sport then. Anyhow, I
      don't propose to add my quota to the bill Trent's got to pay, poor devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey's face softened as she turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One can't help feeling pitifully sorry for him," she admitted. "To have
      had Sara&mdash;and then to have lost her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a whimsical light in Herrick's eyes as he answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, at least," he said, "he <i>has</i> had her, if only for a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey paused with her hand upon the latch of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine Garth&mdash;asked for what he wanted!" she observed, and
      vanished precipitately through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audrey!" Miles started up, but, by the time he reached the house door,
      she was already disappearing through the gateway into the road and beyond
      pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must have <i>run</i>!" he commented ruefully to himself as he
      returned to the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discovery seemed to afford him food for reflection. For a long time
      he sat very quietly in his chair, apparently arguing out with himself some
      knotty point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had his thoughts, at the moment, any connection with the recent
      discussion of Garth Trent's affairs. It was only after the Lavender Lady
      had returned, a little pink about the eyelids, that the recollection of
      the original object of Mrs. Maynard's visit recurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, his brows drew together in a sudden concentration of
      thought, and an inarticulate exclamation escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Livinia looked up from the delicate piece of cobwebby lace she was
      finishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, dear?" she asked absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't say anything," he smiled back at her. "I was thinking rather
      hard, that's all, and just remembered something I had forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lavender Lady looked a trifle mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I quite understand, Miles dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick, on his way to the door, stooped to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I, Lavender Lady. That's just the devil of it," he answered
      cryptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed out of the room and upstairs, presently returning with a couple
      of letters, held together by an elastic band, in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They smelt musty as he unfolded them; evidently they had not seen the
      light of day for a good many years. But Miles seemed to find them of
      extraordinary interest, for he subjected the closely written sheets to a
      first, and second, and even a third perusal. Then he replaced the elastic
      band round them and shut them away in a drawer, locking the latter
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later, Garth Trent received a note from Herrick, asking
      him to come and see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't been near us for days," it ran. "Remember Mahomet and the
      mountain, and as I can't come to you, look me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, in its quiet avoidance of any reference to recent events, was
      like cooling rain falling upon a parched and thirsty earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the history of the court-martial had become common property, Garth
      had been through hell. It was extraordinary how quickly the story had
      leaked out, passing from mouth to mouth until there was hardly a cottage
      in Monkshaven that was not in possession of it, with lurid and fictitious
      detail added thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid at the Cliff Hotel had been the primary source of
      information. From the further side of the connecting-door of an adjoining
      room, she had listened with interest to the conversation which had taken
      place between Elisabeth and Sara on the day following the Haven Woods
      picnic, and had proceeded to circulate the news with the avidity of her
      class. Nor had certain gossipy members of the picnic party refrained from
      canvassing threadbare the significance of the unfortunate scene which had
      taken place on that occasion&mdash;contributory evidence to the truth of
      the chambermaid's account of what she had overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole town hummed with the tale, and Garth had not long been allowed
      to remain in ignorance of the fact. Anonymous letters reached him almost
      daily&mdash;for it must be remembered that ten years of an aloof existence
      at Monkshaven had not endeared him to his neighbours. They had resented
      what they chose to consider his exclusiveness, and, now that it was so
      humiliatingly explained, the meaner spirits amongst them took this way of
      paying off old scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was suggested by one of the anonymous writers that Trent's continued
      presence in the district was felt to be a blot on the fair fame of
      Monkshaven; and, by another, that should the rumours now flying hither and
      thither concerning the imminence of a European war materialize into fact,
      the French Foreign Legion offered opportunities for such as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth tore the letters into fragments, pitching them contemptuously into
      the waste-paper basket; but, nevertheless, they were like so many gnats
      buzzing about an open wound, adding to its torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Brady, with a lively recollection of the few days in gaol which
      Trent had procured him in recompense for his poaching proclivities, was
      loud in his denunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retreated, they calls it," he observed, with fine scorn. "Runned away's
      the plain English of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this pronouncement all the loafers round the hotel garage
      cordially agreed, and, subsequently, black looks and muttered comments
      followed Garth's appearance in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all of which Garth opposed a stony indifference&mdash;since, after all,
      these lesser things were of infinitely small moment to a man whose whole
      life was lying in ruins about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was good of you to ask me over," he told Herrick, as they shook hands.
      "Sure you're not afraid of contamination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure," replied Miles, smiling serenely. "Besides, I had a
      particular reason for wishing to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles unlocked the drawer where he had laid aside the papers he had
      perused with so much interest two days ago, and, slipping them out of the
      elastic bands that held them, handed them to Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like you to read those documents, if you will," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence while Trent's eyes travelled swiftly down the
      closely written sheets. When he looked up from their perusal his
      expression was perfectly blank. Miles could glean nothing from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth quietly tendered him back the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Herrick," was all he
      vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it isn't true?" asked Miles searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds improbable," replied Trent composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles reflected a moment. Then, slowly replacing the papers within the
      elastic band, he remarked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll take Sara's opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had desired to break down the other's guard of indifference, he
      succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent sprang to his feet, his hand outstretched as though to snatch the
      letters back again. His eyes blazed excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No! You mustn't do that&mdash;you can't do that! It's&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
      You won't understand&mdash;but those papers must be destroyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick's fingers closed firmly round the papers in question, and he
      slipped them into the inside pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They certainly will not be destroyed," he replied. "I hold them in trust.
      But, tell me, why should I <i>not</i> show them to Sara? It seems to me
      the one obvious thing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Believe me, it could do no good, and it might do an infinity of
      harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick looked incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see that," he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so, nevertheless."
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you mean," said Herrick, breaking it at last, "that I'm to hold my
      tongue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very unfair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you published that information abroad, it's unfair to Tim. Have
      you thought of that? He, at least, is perfectly innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, man, it's inconceivable&mdash;grotesque!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I gave Elisabeth Durward my promise, and she has married and
      borne a son, trusting to that promise. My lips are closed&mdash;now and
      always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mine are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will be, Miles, if I ask it. Don't you see, there's no going back
      for me now? I can't wipe out the past. I made a bad mistake&mdash;a
      mistake many a youngster similarly circumstanced might have made. And I've
      been paying for it ever since. I must go on paying to the end&mdash;it's
      my honour that's involved. That's why I ask you not to show those
      letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles looked unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forged my own fetters, Herrick," continued Trent. "In a way, I'm
      responsible for Tim Durward's existence and I can't damn his chances at
      the outset. After all, he's at the beginning of things. I'm getting
      towards the end. At least"&mdash;wearily&mdash;"I hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick's quick glance took in the immense alteration the last few days
      had wrought in Trent's appearance. The man had aged visibly, and his face
      was worn and lined, the eyes burning feverishly in their sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're good for another thirty or forty years, bar accidents," said
      Herrick at last, deliberately. "Are you going to make those years worse
      than worthless to you by this crazy decision?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no alternative. Good Lord, man!"&mdash;with savage irritability&mdash;"you
      don't suppose I'm enjoying it, do you? But I've <i>no way out</i>. I took
      a certain responsibility on myself&mdash;and I must see it through. I
      can't shirk it now, just because pay-day's come. I can do nothing except
      stick it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about Sara?" said Herrick quietly. "Has she no claim to be
      considered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost flinched from the look of measureless anguish that leapt into
      the others man's eyes in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, man, leave Sara out of it!" Garth exclaimed thickly.
      "I've cursed myself enough for the suffering I've brought on her. I was a
      mad fool to let her know I cared. But I thought, as Garth Trent, that I
      had shut the door on the past. I ought to have known that the door of the
      past remains eternally ajar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles nodded understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you were to blame," he said. "It's Mrs. Durward who has
      pulled the door wide open. She's stolen your new life from you&mdash;the
      life you had built up. Trent, you owe that woman nothing! Let me show this
      letter, and the other that goes with it, to Sara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent shook his head in mute refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," he said at last. "Elisabeth must be forgiven. The best woman in
      the world may lose all sense of right and wrong when it's a question of
      her child. But, even so, I can't consent to the making public of that
      letter." He rose and paced the room restlessly. "Man! Man!" he cried at
      last, coming to a halt in front of Herrick. "Can't you see&mdash;that
      woman trusted me with her whole life, and with the life of any child that
      she might bear, when she married on the strength of my promise. And I must
      keep faith with her. It's the one poor rag of honour left me, Herrick!"&mdash;with
      intense bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Then, at last, Miles held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've beaten me," he said sadly. "I won't destroy the letters. As I
      said, they are a trust. But the secret is safe with me, after this. You've
      tied my hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get used to it," he commented. "Mine have been tied for
      three-and-twenty years&mdash;though even yet I don't wear my bonds with
      grace, precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had become once more the hermit of old acquaintance&mdash;sardonic,
      harsh, his emotions hidden beneath that curt indifference of manner with
      which those who knew him were painfully familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men shook hands in silence, and a few minutes later, Herrick, left
      alone, replaced the letters in the drawer whence he had taken them, and,
      turning the key upon them, slipped it into his pocket.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DEFEAT
    </h3>
    <p>
      In remote country districts that memorable Fourth of August, when England
      declared war on Germany, came and went unostentatiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      People read the news a trifle breathlessly, reflected with a sigh of
      contentment on the invincible British Navy, and with a little gust of
      prideful triumph upon the Expeditionary force&mdash;ready to the last
      burnished button of each man's tunic&mdash;and proceeded quietly with
      their usual avocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the soaring Bank Rate, and business men on holiday raced back to
      London to contend with the new financial conditions and assure their
      credit. That was all that happened&mdash;at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few foresaw that the gaunt, grim Spectre of War had come to dwell in their
      very midst, nor that soon he would pass from house to house, palace and
      cottage alike, touching first this man, then that, on the shoulder, with
      the single word "Come!" on his lips, until gradually the nations, one by
      one, left their tasks of peace and rose and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monkshaven, in common with other seaside towns, witnessed the sudden
      exodus of City men when the climbing Bank Rate sounded its alarm. Beyond
      that, the war, for the moment, reacted very little on its daily processes
      of life. There was no disorganization of amusements&mdash;tennis, boating,
      and bathing went on much as usual, and clever people, proud of their
      ability to add two and two together and make four of them, announced that
      it was all explained now why certain young officers in the neighbourhood
      had been hurriedly recalled a few days previously, and their leave
      cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the black news of that long, desperate retreat from Mons,
      shaking the nation to its very soul, and in the wave of high courage and
      endeavour that swept responsively across the country, the smaller things
      began to fall into their little place.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Sara, stricken by her own individual sorrow, the war came like a
      rushing, mighty wind, rousing her from the brooding, introspective habit
      which had laid hold of her and bracing her to take a fresh grip upon life.
      Its immense demands, the illimitable suffering it carried in its train,
      lifted her out of the contemplation of her own personal grief into a
      veritable passion of pity for the world agony beating up around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with Sara, to compassionate meant to succour. Nor did it require more
      than the first few weeks of war to demonstrate where such help as she was
      capable of giving was most sorely needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been through a course of First Aid and held her certificate, and,
      thanks to a year in France when she was seventeen&mdash;a much-grudged
      year, at the time, since it had separated her from her beloved Patrick&mdash;and
      to a natural facility for the language, inherited from her French
      forbears, she spoke French almost as fluently as she did English.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France they were crying out for nurses, for at that period of the war
      there was work for any woman who had even a little knowledge plus the grit
      to face the horrors of those early days, and it was to France that Sara
      forthwith determined to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard that an old friend of Patrick Lovell's, Lady Arronby by
      name, proposed equipping and taking over to France a party of nurses, and
      she promptly wrote to her, begging that she might be included in the
      little company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Arronby, who had been a sister at a London hospital before her
      marriage, recollected her old friend's ward very clearly. Sara rarely
      failed to make a definite impression, even upon people who only knew her
      slightly, and Lady Arronby, who had known her from her earliest days at
      Barrow, answered her letter without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be delighted to have you with me," she had written. "Even though
      you are not a trained nurse, there's work out there for women of your
      caliber, my dear. So come. It will be a week or two yet before we have all
      our equipment, but I am pushing things on as fast as I can, so hold
      yourself in readiness to come at a day's notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Sara's earliest personal encounter with the reality of the war
      came in a few hurried lines from Elisabeth telling her that Major Durward
      had rejoined the Army and would be going out to France almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara thrilled, and with the thrill came the answering stab of the sword
      that was to pierce her again and again through the long months ahead.
      Garth Trent&mdash;the man she loved&mdash;could have no part nor lot in
      this splendid service of England's sons for England! The country wanted
      brave men now&mdash;not men who faltered when faltering meant failure and
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not seen Garth since that day&mdash;a million years ago it seemed&mdash;when
      she had sent him from her, and he had gone, admitting the justice of her
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no getting behind that. She would have defied Elisabeth, defied
      a whole world of slanderous tongues, had they accused him, if he himself
      had denied the charge. But he had not been able to deny it. It was true&mdash;a
      deadly, official truth, tabulated somewhere in the records of her country,
      that the man she loved had been cashiered for cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge almost crushed her, and she sometimes wondered if there
      could be a keener suffering, in the whole gamut of human pain, than that
      which a woman bears whose high pride in her lover has been laid utterly in
      the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dread of danger, separation&mdash;even death itself&mdash;were not
      comparable with it. Sara envied the women whose men were killed in action.
      At least, they had a splendid memory to hold which nothing could ever soil
      or take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes her thoughts wandered fugitively to Tim. Surely here was his
      chance to break from the bondage his mother had imposed upon him! He had
      not written to her of late, but she felt convinced that she would have
      heard from Elisabeth had he volunteered. She was a little puzzled over his
      silence and inaction. He had seemed so keen last winter at Barrow, when
      together they had discussed this very subject of soldiering. Could it be
      that now, when the opportunity offered, Tim was&mdash;evading it? But the
      thought was dismissed almost as swiftly as it had arisen, and Sara blushed
      scarlet with shame that the bare suspicions should have crossed her mind,
      even for an instant, recognizing it as the outcrop of that bitter
      knowledge which had cut at the very roots of her belief in men's courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were men around her whose readiness to make the great sacrifice
      combated the poison of one man's failure. Daily she heard of this or that
      man whom she knew, either personally or by name, having volunteered and
      been accepted, and very often she had to listen to Miles Herrick's fierce
      rebellion against the fact that he was ineligible, and endeavour to
      console him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Audrey Maynard who plumbed the full depths of bitterness in
      Herrick's heart. She had been teaching him to knit, and he was floundering
      through the intricacies of turning his first heel when one day he
      surprised her by hurling the sock, needles and all, to the other end of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's work for a man when his country's at war! My God! Audrey, I don't
      know how I'm going to bear it&mdash;to lie here on my couch, knitting&mdash;<i>knitting!</i>&mdash;when
      men are out there dying! Why won't they take a lame man? Can't a lame man
      fire a gun&mdash;and then die like the rest of 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey looked at him pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, war takes only the best&mdash;the youngest and the fittest. But
      there's plenty of work for the women and men at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the women and crocks?" countered Miles bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;for the crocks, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Audrey, I'm an utterly useless person&mdash;a cumberer of the
      ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in my eyes, Miles," she answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her glance, and read, at last, what&mdash;as she told him later&mdash;he
      might have read there any time during the last six months, had he chosen
      to look for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that, Audrey?" he asked, suddenly gripping her hands hard.
      "All of it&mdash;all that it implies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped to her knees beside his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!" she said, between laughing and crying. "I've been meaning
      it&mdash;'all of it'&mdash;for ever so long. Only&mdash;only you won't ask
      me to marry you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I? A lame man, and not even a rich one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe," said Audrey composedly, "we've argued both those points
      before&mdash;from a strictly impersonal point of view! Couldn't you&mdash;couldn't
      you get over your objection to coming to live with me at Greenacres,
      dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey always declared, afterwards, that it had required the most blatant
      encouragement on her part to induce Miles to propose to her, and that, but
      for the war&mdash;which convinced him that he was of no use to any one
      else&mdash;he never would have done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presumably she was able to supply the requisite stimulus, for when the
      Lavender Lady joined them later on in the afternoon, she found herself
      called upon to perform that function of sheer delight to every old maid of
      the right sort&mdash;namely, to bestow her blessing on a pair of newly
      betrothed lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara received the news the next morning, and though naturally, by
      contrast, it seemed to add a keener edge to her own grief, she was still
      able to rejoice whole-heartedly over this little harvesting of joy which
      her two friends had snatched from amid the world's dreadful harvesting of
      pain and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the same post as the radiant letters from Miles and Audrey came one
      from Elisabeth Durward. She wrote distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim is determined to volunteer," ran her letter. "I can't let him go,
      Sara. He is my only son, and I don't see why he should be claimed from me
      by this horrible war. I have persuaded him to wait until he has seen you.
      That is all he will consent to. So will you come and do what you can to
      dissuade him? There is a cord by which you could hold him if you would."
    </p>
    <p>
      A transient smile crossed Sara's face as she pictured Tim gravely
      consenting to await her opinion on the matter. He knew&mdash;none better!&mdash;what
      it would be, and, without doubt, he had merely agreed to the suggestion in
      the hope that her presence might ease the strain and serve to comfort his
      mother a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara telegraphed that she would come to Barrow Court the following day,
      and, on her arrival, found Tim waiting for her at the station in his
      two-seater.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said with a grin, as the little car slid away along the
      familiar road. "Have you come to persuade me to be a good boy and stay at
      home, Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I've not," she replied, smiling. "I'm gong to talk sense to
      Elisabeth. Oh! Tim boy, how I envy you! It's splendid to be a man these
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded silently, but she could read in his expression the tranquil
      satisfaction that his decision had brought. She had seen the same look on
      other men's faces, when, after a long struggle with the woman-love that
      could not help but long to hold them back, the final decision had been
      taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the lodge gates, Tim handed over the car to the chauffeur who
      met them there, evidently by arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we'd walk across the park," he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara acquiesced delightedly. There was a tender, reminiscent pleasure in
      strolling along the winding paths that had once been so happily familiar,
      and, hardly conscious of the sudden silence which had fallen upon her
      companion, her thoughts slipped back to the old days at Barrow when she
      had wandered, with Patrick beside her in his wheeled chair, along these
      selfsame paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little thrill, half pain, half pleasure, she noted each
      well-remembered landmark. There was the arbour where they used to shelter
      from a shower, built with sloped boards at its entrance so that Patrick's
      chair could easily be wheeled into it; now they were passing the
      horse-chestnut tree which she herself had planted years ago&mdash;with the
      head gardener's assistance!&mdash;in place of one that had been struck by
      lightning. It had grown into a sturdy young sapling by this time. Here was
      the Queen's Bench&mdash;an old stone seat where Queen Elisabeth was
      supposed to have once sat and rested for a few minutes when paying a visit
      to Barrow Court. Sara reflected, with a smile, that if history speaks
      truly, the Virgin Queen must have spent quite a considerable portion of
      her time in visiting the houses of her subjects! And here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara!" Tim's voice broke suddenly across the recollections that were
      thronging into her mind. There was a curious intent quality in his tone
      that arrested her attention, filling her with a nervous foreboding of what
      he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara, you know, of course, as well as I do, that I am going to volunteer.
      I let mother send for you, because&mdash;well, because I thought you would
      make it a little easier for her, for one thing. But I had another reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you?" Sara spoke mechanically. They had paused beside the Queen's
      Bench, and half-unconsciously she laid her ungloved hand caressingly on
      the seat's high back. The stone struck cold against the warmth of her
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." Tim was speaking again, still in that oddly direct manner. "I want
      to ask you&mdash;now, before I go to France&mdash;whether there will ever
      be any chance for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara turned her eyes to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that I'm asking you once again if you will marry me? If you will&mdash;if
      I can go away leaving <i>my wife</i> in England, I shall have so much the
      more to fight for. But if you can't give me the answer I wish&mdash;well"&mdash;with
      a curious little smile&mdash;"it will make death easier, should it come&mdash;that's
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet, grave directness of the speech was very unlike the old,
      impetuous Tim of former days. It brought with it to Sara's mind a definite
      recognition of the fact that the man had replaced the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Tim," she responded quietly. "I made one mistake&mdash;in promising
      to marry you when I loved another man. I won't repeat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But"&mdash;Tim's face expressed sheer wonder and amazement&mdash;"you
      don't still care for Garth Trent&mdash;for that blackguard? Oh!"
      remorsefully, as he saw her wince&mdash;"forgive me, Sara, but this war
      makes one feel even more bitterly about such a thing than one would in
      normal times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;I understand," she replied quietly. "I'm&mdash;ashamed of
      loving him." She turned her head restlessly aside. "But, don't you see,
      love can't be made and unmade to order. It just <i>happens</i>. And it's
      happened to me. In the circumstances, I can't say I like it. But there it
      is. I do love Garth&mdash;and I can't <i>unlove</i> him. At least, not
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But some day, Sara, some day?" he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never marry anybody now, Tim. If&mdash;if ever I 'get over' this
      fool feeling for Garth, I know how it would leave me. I shall be quite
      cold and hard inside&mdash;like that stone"&mdash;pointing to the Queen's
      Bench. "I wish&mdash;I wish I had reached that stage now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Tim held out his hand, and she laid hers within it, meeting his
      grave eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't ever bother you again," he said, at last, quietly. "I think I
      understand, Sara, and&mdash;and, old girl, I'm awfully sorry. I wish I
      could have saved you&mdash;that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped his head and kissed her&mdash;frankly, as a big brother might,
      and Sara, recognizing that henceforth she would find in him only the good
      comrade of earlier days, kissed him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Tim," she said. "I knew you would understand. And, please, we
      won't ever speak of it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we won't speak of it again," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tucked his arm under hers, and they walked on together in the direction
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," she said, "let's go to Elisabeth and break it to her that we
      are&mdash;both&mdash;going out to France as soon as we can get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" he exclaimed. "You going out? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going with Lady Arronby. I want to go&mdash;badly. I want to be in
      the heart of things. You don't suppose"&mdash;with a rather shaky little
      laugh&mdash;"that I can stay quietly at home in England&mdash;and knit, do
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I suppose <i>you</i> couldn't. But I don't half like it. The women
      who go&mdash;out there&mdash;have got to face things. I shan't like to
      think of you running risks&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim, if you talk nonsense of that kind, I'll revenge myself by urging
      Elisabeth to keep you at home," she declared. "Oh! Tim boy, can't you see
      that just now I must have something to do&mdash;something that will fill
      up every moment&mdash;and keep me from thinking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim heard the cry that underlay the words. There was no misunderstanding
      it. He squeezed her arm and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, old thing, I won't try to dissuade you. I can guess a little
      of how you're feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's interview with Elisabeth was very different from anything she had
      expected. She had anticipated passionate reproaches, tears even, for an
      attractive women who has been consistently spoiled by her menkind is, of
      all her sex, the least prepared to bow to the force of circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was none of these things. It almost seemed as though in that
      first searching glance of hers, which flashed from Sara's face to the
      well-beloved one of her son, Elisabeth had recognized and accepted that,
      in the short space of time since these two had met, the decision
      concerning Tim's future had been taken out of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when, in the course of their long, intimate talk together, she
      had drawn from Sara the acknowledgment that she had once again refused to
      be Tim's wife, that her control wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Sara, surely&mdash;surely you can't still have any thought of
      marrying Garth Trent?" There was a hint of something like terror in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Sara responded wearily. "No, I shall never marry&mdash;Garth Trent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why won't you&mdash;why can't you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry Tim?"&mdash;quietly. "Because, although I shall never marry Garth
      now, I haven't stopped loving him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you can still care for him&mdash;now that you know what
      kind of man he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Good Heavens, Elisabeth!"&mdash;the irritation born of frayed nerves
      hardened Sara's voice so that it was almost unrecognizable&mdash;"you
      can't turn love on and off as you would a tap! I shall never marry <i>anybody</i>
      now. Tim understands that, and&mdash;you must understand it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking her passionate sincerity. The truth&mdash;that Sara
      would never, as long as she lived, put another in the place Garth Trent
      had held&mdash;seemed borne in upon Elisabeth that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strangled cry she sank back into her chair, and her eyes, fixed on
      Sara's small, stern-set face, held a strange, beaten look. As she sat
      there, her hands gripping the chair-arms, there was something about her
      whole attitude that suggested defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it's all been useless&mdash;quite useless!" she muttered in a queer,
      whispering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not looking at Sara now. Her vision was turned inward, and she
      seemed to be utterly oblivious of the other's presence. "Useless!" she
      repeated, still in that strange, whispering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has been useless?" asked Sara curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth started, and stared at her for a moment in a vacant fashion.
      Then, all at once, her mind seemed to come back to the present, and
      simultaneously the familiar watchful look sprang into her eyes. Sara was
      oddly conscious of being reminded of a sentry who has momentarily slept at
      his post, and then, awakening suddenly, feverishly resumed his vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was I saying?" Elisabeth brushed her hand distressfully across her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said that it had all been useless," repeated Sara. "What did you
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth paused a moment before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant that all my hopes were useless," she explained at last. "The
      hopes I had that some day you would be Tim's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they're quite useless&mdash;if that is what you meant," replied
      Sara. But there was a perplexed expression in her eyes. She had a feeling
      that Elisabeth was not being quite frank with her&mdash;that that
      whispered confession of failure signified something other than the simple
      interpretations vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing worried her a little, nagging at the back of her mind with the
      pertinacity common to any little unexplained incident that has caught
      one's attention. But, in the course of a few days, the manifold happenings
      of daily life drove it out of her thoughts, not to recur until many months
      had passed and other issues paved the way for its resurgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara remained at Barrow until Tim had volunteered and been accepted, and
      the settlement of her own immediate plans synchronizing with this last
      event, it came about that it was only two hours after Tim's departure that
      she, too, bade farewell to Elisabeth, in order to join up in London with
      Lady Arronby's party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth stood at the head of the great flight of granite steps at Barrow
      and waved her hand as the car bore Sara swiftly away, and across the
      latter's mind flashed the memory of that day, nearly a year ago, when she
      herself had stood in the same place, waiting to welcome Elisabeth to her
      new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between then and now struck her poignantly. She recalled
      Elisabeth as she had been that day&mdash;gracious, smiling, queening it
      delightfully over her two big men, husband and son, who openly worshipped
      her. Now, there remained only a great empty house, and that solitary
      figure on the doorstep, standing there with white face and lips that
      smiled perfunctorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elisabeth turned slowly back into the house as the car disappeared round
      the curve of the drive. For her, the moment was doubly bitter. One by one,
      husband, son, and the woman whom she had ardently longed to see that son's
      wife, had been claimed from her by the pitiless demands of the madness men
      call War.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was still more for her to face. There was the utter downfall of
      all her hopes, the defeat of all her purposes. She had striven with the
      whole force that was in her to assure Tim's happiness. To compass this,
      she had torn down the curtain of the past, proclaiming a man's shame and
      hurling headlong into the dust the new life he had built up for himself,
      and with it had gone a woman's faith, and trust, and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it had all been so futile! Two lives ruined, and the purchase price
      paid in tears of blood; and, after all, Tim's happiness was as utterly
      remote and beyond attainment as though no torrent of disaster had been let
      loose to further it! Elisabeth had bartered her soul in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the solitude which was all the war had left her, she recognized this,
      and, since she was normally a woman of kind and generous impulses, she
      suffered in the realization of the spoiled and mutilated lives for which
      she was responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she would have acted differently were the same choice presented
      to her again. She did not <i>want</i> to hurt people, but the primitive
      maternal instinct, which was the pivot of her being, blinded her to the
      claims of others if those claims reacted adversely on her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only now, in the bitterness of defeat, as she looked back upon her
      midnight interview with Garth Trent, she was conscious of a sick
      repugnance. It had not been a pleasant thing, that thrusting of a knife
      into an old wound. This, too, she had done for Tim's sake. The pity of it
      was that Garth had suffered needlessly&mdash;uselessly!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thought the issue of events hung solely betwixt him and her son,
      and, with her mind concentrated on this idea, she had overlooked the
      possibility of any other outcome. But the acceptance of an unexpected
      sequence had been forced upon her&mdash;Sara would never marry any one
      now! Elisabeth recognized that all her efforts had been in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the supreme bitterness, from which all that was honest and upright
      within her shrank with inward shame and self-loathing, lay in the fact
      that she, above all others, owed Garth Trent&mdash;that which he had
      begged of her in vain&mdash;the tribute of silence concerning the past.

      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FURNACE
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Sara took her seat on board the train for Monkshaven, she was conscious
      of that strange little thrill of the wanderer returned which is the common
      possession of the explorer and of the school-girl at their first sight of
      the old familiar scenes from which they have been exiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly believe that barely a year had elapsed since she had
      quitted Monkshaven. So many things had happened&mdash;so many changes
      taken place. Audrey had been transformed into Mrs. Herrick; Tim had been
      given a commission; and Molly, the one-time butterfly, was now become a
      working-bee&mdash;a member of the V.A.D. and working daily at Oldhampton
      Hospital. Sara could scarcely picture such a metamorphosis!
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst news had been that of Major Durward's death&mdash;he had been
      killed in action, gallantly leading his men, in the early part of the
      year. Elisabeth had written to Sara at the time&mdash;a wonderfully brave,
      simple letter, facing her loss with a fortitude which Sara, remembering
      her adoration for her husband and her curious antipathy to soldiering as a
      profession, had not dared to anticipate. There was something rather
      splendid about her quiet acceptance of it. It was Elisabeth at her best&mdash;humanly
      hurt and broken, but almost heroic in her endurance now that the blow had
      actually fallen. And Sara prayed that no further sacrifice might be
      demanded from her&mdash;prayed that Tim might come through safely. For
      herself, she mourned Geoffrey Durward as one good comrade does another.
      She knew that his death would leave a big gap in the ranks of those she
      counted friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a wonderful year&mdash;that year which she had passed in
      France&mdash;wonderful in its histories of tragedy and self-sacrifice, and
      in its revelation both of the brutality and of the infinite fineness of
      humanity. Few could have passed through such an experience and remained
      unchanged, certainly no one as acutely sentient and receptive as Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt as though she had been pitchforked into a vast melting-pot, where
      the cast-iron generalizations and traditions which most people consider
      their opinions grew flexible and fluid in the scorching heat of the
      furnace, assimilating so much of the other ingredients in the cauldron
      that they could never reassume their former unqualified and rigid state.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that year of crowded life and ardent service was over, and she was
      side-tracked by medical orders for an indefinite period.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back to England," her doctor had told her, "to the quietest corner in
      the country you can find&mdash;and try to forget that there <i>is</i> a
      war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This thin, eager-faced young woman, of whom every one on the hospital
      staff spoke in such glowing terms, interested him enormously. He could see
      that her year's work had taken out of her about double what it would have
      taken out of any one less sensitively alive, and he made a shrewd guess
      that something over and above the mere hard work accounted for that
      curiously fine-drawn look which he had observed in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a hastily snatched meal, before the advent of another batch of
      casualties, he had sounded Lady Arronby on the subject. The latter shook
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you very little. I believe there was a bad love-affair just
      before the war. All I know is that she was engaged and that the engagement
      was broken off very suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! And she's been living on her reserves ever since. Pack her off to
      England&mdash;and do it quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      So October found Sara back in England once again, and as the train steamed
      into Monkshaven station, and her eager gaze fell on the little group of
      people on the platform, waiting to welcome her return, she felt a sudden
      rush of tears to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She winked them away, and leaned out of the window. They were all there&mdash;big
      Dick Selwyn, and Molly, looking like a masquerading Venus in her V.A.D.
      uniform, the Lavender Lady and Miles, and&mdash;radiant and
      well-turned-out as ever&mdash;Mile's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Herrick's wedding had taken place very unobtrusively. About a month
      after Sara had crossed to France, Miles and Audrey had walked quietly into
      church one morning at nine o'clock and got married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monkshaven had been frankly disappointed. The gossips, who had so
      frequently partaken of Audrey's hospitality and then discussed her
      acrimoniously, had counted upon the lavish entertainment with which, even
      in war-time, the wedding of a millionaire's widow might be expected to be
      celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of which, there had been this "hole-and-corner" sort of marriage,
      as the disappointed femininity of Monkshaven chose to call it, and, after
      a very brief honeymoon, Miles and Audrey had returned and thrown
      themselves heart and soul into the work of organizing and equipping a
      convalescent hospital for officers, of which Audrey had undertaken to bear
      the entire cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the mouths of Audrey's detractors were closed. She was no
      longer "that shocking little widow with the dyed hair," but a woman who
      had married into a branch of one of the oldest families in the county, and
      whose immense private fortune had enabled her to give substantial help to
      her country in its need.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's simply splendid of you, Audrey," declared Sara warmly, as
      they were all partaking of tea at Greenacres, whither Audrey's car had
      borne them from the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what else could I do with my money? I've got such a sickening
      lot of it, you see! Besides"&mdash;with a bantering glance at her husband&mdash;"I
      think it was only the prospect of being of some use at my hospital which
      induced Miles to marry me! He's my private secretary, you know, and boss
      of the commissariat department."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quartermaster, at your service, miss," he said cheerfully, adding with a
      chuckle: "I saw my chance of getting a job if I married Audrey, so of
      course I took it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking amazingly well. The fact of being of some use in the world
      had acted upon him like a tonic, and there was no misinterpreting the
      glance of complete and happy understanding that passed between him and his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad as she was to see it, it served to remind Sara painfully of all that
      she had missed, to stir anew the aching longing for Garth Trent, which,
      though struggled against, and beaten down, and sometimes temporarily
      crowded out by the thousand claims of each day's labour, had been with her
      all through the long months of her absence from Monkshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this which had worn her so fine, not the hard physical work that
      she had been doing. Always slender, and built on racing lines, there was
      something almost ethereal about her now, and her sombre eyes looked nearly
      double their size in her small face of which the contour was so painfully
      distinct. Yet she was as vivid and alive as ever; she seemed to diffuse,
      as it were, a kind of spiritual brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She makes one think of a flame," Audrey told her husband when they were
      alone once more. "There is something so <i>vital</i> about her, in spite
      of that curiously frail look she has."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's burning herself out," he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Miles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! I should think it's self-evident. She's exactly as much in
      love with Trent as she was a year ago, and she's fighting against it every
      hour of her life. And the strain's breaking her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we do something to help?" Audrey put her question with a helpless
      consciousness of its futility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick's eyes kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," he answered with quiet decision. "Every one must work out his
      own salvation&mdash;if it's to be a salvation worth having."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick had delved to the root of the matter when he had declared that
      Sara was exactly as much in love as she had been a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had realized this for herself, and it had converted life into an
      endless conflict between her love for Garth and her shamed sense of his
      unworthiness. And now, her return to Monkshaven, to its familiar,
      memory-haunted scenes, had quickened the struggle into new vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the broadened outlook born of her recent experiences, she began to
      ask herself whether a man need be condemned, utterly and for ever, for a
      momentary loss of nerve&mdash;even Elisabeth had admitted that it was
      probably no more than that! And then, conversely, her fierce detestation
      of that particular form of weakness, inculcated in her from her childhood
      by Patrick Lovell, would spring up protestingly, and she would shrink with
      loathing from the thought that she had given her love to a man who had
      been convicted of that very thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the attitude he had assumed in regard to the war calculated to
      placate her. She had learned from Molly that he had abstained from taking
      up any form of war-work whatsoever. He appeared to be utterly indifferent
      to the need of the moment, and the whole of Monkshaven buzzed with
      patriotic disapprobation of his conduct. There were few idle hands there
      now. A big munitions factory had been established at Oldhampton, and its
      demands, added to the necessities of the hospital, left no loophole of
      excuse for slackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara reflected bitterly that the sole courage of which Garth seemed
      possessed was a kind of cold, moral courage&mdash;brazen-facedness, the
      townspeople termed it&mdash;which enabled him to refuse doggedly to be
      driven out of Monkshaven, even though the whole weight of public opinion
      was dead against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the recollection of that day on Devil's Hood Island, when he had
      deliberately risked his life to save her reputation, would return to her
      with overwhelming force&mdash;mocking the verdict of the court-martial,
      repudiating the condemnation which had made her thrust him out of her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the pendulum swung, this way and that, lacerating her heart each time
      it swept forward or back. But the blind agony of her recoil, when she had
      first learned the story of that tragic happening on the Indian frontier,
      was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, overmastered by the horror of the thing, she had flung violently
      away from Garth, feeling herself soiled and dishonoured by the mere fact
      of her love for him, too revolted to contemplate anything other than the
      severance of the tie between them as swiftly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with the widened sympathies and understanding which the past year of
      intimacy with human nature at its strongest, and at its weakest, had
      brought her, new thoughts and new possibilities were awaking within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furnace&mdash;that fiercely burning furnace of life at its intensest&mdash;had
      done its work.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON CRABTREE MOOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Tim is wounded, and has been recommended for the Military Cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara made the double announcement quite calmly. The two things so often
      went together&mdash;it was the grey and gold warp and waft of war with
      which people had long since grown pathetically familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How splendid!" Molly enthused with sparkling eyes, adding quickly, "I
      hope he's not very badly wounded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elisabeth doesn't give any particulars in her letter. I can't understand
      her," Sara continued, her brows contracting in a puzzled fashion. "She
      seems so calm about it. She has always hated the idea of Tim's soldiering,
      yet now, although she's lost her husband and her son is wounded, she's
      taking it finely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn looked up from filling his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's answering to the call&mdash;like every one else," he observed
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Sara shook her head. "I don't feel as though it were that. It's
      something more individual. Perhaps"&mdash;thoughtfully&mdash;"it's pride
      of a kind. The sort of impression I have is that she's so proud&mdash;so
      proud of Geoffrey's fine death, and of Tim's winning the Military Cross,
      that it has compensated in some way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The war's full of surprises," remarked Molly reflectively. "I never was
      so astonished in my life as when I found that Lester Kent's wife believed
      him to be a model of all the virtues! I wrote and told you&mdash;didn't I,
      Sara?&mdash;that he was sent to Oldhampton Hospital? He got smashed up,
      driving a motor ambulance, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you wrote and said that he died in hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, his wife came to see him, with her little boy. She was the sweetest
      thing, and so plucky. 'My dear,' she said to me, after it was all over, 'I
      hope you'll find a husband as dear and good. He was so loyal and true&mdash;and
      now that he's gone, I shall always have that to remember!'" Molly's eyes
      had grown very big and bright. "Oh! Sara," she went on, catching her
      breath a little, "supposing you hadn't brought me home&mdash;that night,
      she would have had no beautiful memory to help her now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet the memory is an utterly false one&mdash;though I suppose it will
      help her just the same! It's knowing the truth that hurts, sometimes." And
      Sara's lips twisted a little. "What a droll world it is&mdash;of shame and
      truth all mixed up&mdash;the ugly and the beautiful all lumped together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And just now," put in Selwyn quietly, "it's so full of beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beauty?" exclaimed both girls blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn nodded, his eyes luminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't heroism beautiful&mdash;and self-sacrifice?" he said. "And this
      war's full of it. Sometimes, when I read the newspapers, I think God
      Himself must be surprised at the splendid things the men He made have
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara turned away, swept by the recollection of one man she knew who had
      nothing splendid, nothing glorious, to his credit. Almost invariably, any
      discussion of the war ended by hurting her horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take that basket of flowers across to the 'Convalescent' now, I
      think," she said, rising abruptly from her seat by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selwyn nodded, mentally anathematizing himself for having driven her
      thoughts inward, and Molly, who had developed amazingly of late, tactfully
      refrained from offering to accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Convalescent Hospital, situated on the crest of a hill above the town,
      was a huge mansion which had been originally built by a millionaire named
      Rattray, who, coming afterwards to financial grief, had found himself too
      poor to live in it when it was completed. It had been frankly impossible
      as a dwelling for any one less richly dowered with this world's goods,
      and, in consequence, when the place was thrown on the market, no purchaser
      would be found for it&mdash;since Monkshaven offered no attraction to
      millionaires in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then it had been known as Rattray's Folly, and it was not until
      Audrey cast covetous eyes upon it for her convalescent soldiers that the
      "Folly" had served any purpose other than that of a warning to people not
      to purchase boots too big for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short cut from Sunnyside to the hospital lay through Crabtree Moor, and
      as Sara took her way across the rough strip of moorland, dotted with
      clumps of gorse and heather, her thoughts flew back to that day when she
      and Garth had encountered Black Brady there, and to the ridiculous quarrel
      which had ensued in consequence of Garth's refusal to condone the man's
      offence. For days they had not spoken to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking backward, how utterly insignificant seemed that petty disagreement
      now! Had she but known the bitter separation that must come, she would
      have let no trifling difference, such as this had been, rob her of a
      single precious moment of their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if she and Garth would ever meet again. She had been back in
      Monkshaven for some weeks now, but he had studiously avoided meeting her,
      shutting himself up within the solitude of Far End.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with her thoughts still centred round the man she loved, she
      lifted her eyes and saw him standing quite close to her. He was leaning
      against a gate which gave egress from the moor into an adjacent pasture
      field towards which her steps were bent. His arms, loosely folded, rested
      upon the top of the gate, and he was looking away from her towards the
      distant vista of sea and cliff. Evidently he had not heard her light
      footsteps on the springy turf, for he made no movement, but remained
      absorbed in his thoughts, unconscious of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara halted as though transfixed. For an instant the whole world seemed to
      rock, and a black mist rose up in front of her, blotting out that solitary
      figure at the gateway. Her heart beat in great, suffocating throbs, and
      her throat ached unbearably, as if a hand had closed upon it and were
      gripping it so tightly that she could not breathe. Then her senses
      steadied, and her gaze leapt to the face outlined in profile against the
      cold background of the winter sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her searching eyes, poignantly observant, sensed a subtle difference in it&mdash;or,
      perhaps, less actually a difference than a certain emphasizing of what had
      been before only latent and foreshadowed. The lean face was still leaner
      than she had known it, and there were deep lines about the mouth&mdash;graven.
      And the mouth itself held something sternly sweet and austere about the
      manner of its closing&mdash;a severity of self-discipline which one might
      look to see on the lips of a man who has made the supreme sacrifice of his
      own will, bludgeoning his desires into submission in response to some
      finely conceived impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognition of this, of the something fine and splendid that had
      stamped itself on Garth's features, came to Sara in a sudden blazoning
      flash of recognition. This was not&mdash;could not be the face of a weak
      man or a coward! And for one transcendent moment of glorious belief sheer
      happiness overwhelmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the same instant, the damning facts stormed up at her&mdash;the
      verdict of the court-martial, the details Elisabeth had supplied, above
      all, Garth's own inability to deny the charge&mdash;and the light of
      momentary ecstasy flared and went out in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inarticulate sound escaped her, forced from her lips by the pang of
      that sudden frustration of leaping hope, and, hearing it, Garth turned and
      saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara!" The name rushed from his lips, shaken with a tumult of emotion.
      And then he was silent, staring at her across the little space that
      separated them, his hand gripping the topmost bar of the gate as though
      for actual physical support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm of his face, that lofty serenity which had been impressed upon
      it, was suddenly all broken up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara!" he repeated, a ring of incredulity in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said flatly. "I've come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved towards him, trying to control the trembling that had seized her
      limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I've just come back from France," she added, making a lame
      attempt to speak conventionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an effort to hold out her hand, and, when his closed around it, she
      felt her whole body thrill at his touch, just as it had been wont to
      thrill in those few, short, golden days when their mutual happiness had
      been undarkened by any shadow from the past. Swiftly, as though all at
      once afraid, she snatched her hand from his clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing in France?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nursing," she answered briefly. "Did you think I could stay here and do&mdash;nothing,
      at such a time as this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was accusation in her tone, but if he felt that her speech reflected
      in any way upon himself, he showed no sign of it. His eyes were roving
      over her, marking the changes wrought in the year that had passed since
      they had met&mdash;the sharpened contour of her face, the too slender
      body, the white fragility of the bare hand which grasped the handle of the
      basket she was carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are looking very ill," he said, at last, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not ill," she replied indifferently. "Only a bit over-tired. As soon
      as I have had a thorough rest I am going back to France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't go back there again?" he exclaimed sharply. "You're not fit for
      such work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I shall go back&mdash;as soon as ever Dr. Selwyn will let me.
      It's little enough to do for the men who are giving&mdash;everything!"
      Suddenly, the pent-up indignation within her broke bounds. "Garth, how can
      you stay here when men are fighting, dying&mdash;out there?" Her voice
      vibrated with the sense of personal shame which his apathy inspired in
      her. "Oh!"&mdash;as though she feared he might wound her yet further by
      advancing the obvious excuse&mdash;"I know you're past military age. But
      other men&mdash;older men than you&mdash;have gone. I know a man of fifty
      who bluffed and got in! There are heaps of back doors into the Army these
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's a back door out of it&mdash;the one through which I was
      kicked out!" he retorted, his mouth setting itself in the familiar bitter
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoffing defiance of his attitude baffled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you want to help your country?" she pleaded. It was horrible to her
      that he should stand aside&mdash;inexplicable except in terms of that
      wretched business on the Indian Frontier, in the hideous truth of which
      only his own acknowledgment had compelled her to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with hard, indifferent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My country made me an outcast," he replied. "I'll remain such."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, even in her shamed bewilderment and anger, she sensed the hurt
      that lay behind the curt speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men who have been cashiered, men who are too old&mdash;they're all going
      back," she urged tremulously, snatching at any weapon that suggested
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him in silence. She felt exactly as though she had been
      beating against a closed door. With a gesture of hopelessness she turned
      away, recognizing the futility of pleading with him further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment"&mdash;he stepped in front of her, barring her path. "I want
      an answer to a question before you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something of his old arrogance in the demand&mdash;the familiar,
      dominating quality which had always swayed her. Despite herself, she
      yielded to it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said unwillingly. "What is it you wish to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know if you are engaged to Tim Durward."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the colour rushed into Sara's white face; then it ebbed
      away, leaving it paler than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said quietly. "I am not." She lifted her eyes, accusing,
      passionately reproachful, to his. "How could you&mdash;even ask me that?
      Did you ever believe I loved you?" she went on fiercely. "And if I did&mdash;could
      I care for any one else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of triumph leapt into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You care still, then?" he asked, and in his voice was blent all the
      exultation, and the wonder, and the piercing torment of love itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara felt herself slipping, knew that she was losing her hold of herself.
      Soon she would be a-wash in a sea of love, helpless to resist as a bit of
      driftwood, and then the waters would close over her head and she would be
      drawn down into the depths of shame which yielding to her love for Garth
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must go&mdash;leave him while she had the power. Summoning up her
      strength, she faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," she answered steadily. "But I pray God every night of my life that
      I may soon cease to care."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with those few words, limitless in their scorn&mdash;for him, and for
      herself because she still loved him&mdash;she turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their contempt seemed to pass him by. His eyes burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Elisabeth has played her stake&mdash;and lost!" he muttered to
      himself. "Ah! Pardon!" he drew aside as she almost brushed past him in her
      sudden haste to escape&mdash;to get away&mdash;and stood, with bared head,
      his eyes fixed on her receding figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a bend in the path through the fields hid her from his sight. But,
      long after she had disappeared, he remained leaning, motionless, against
      the gateway through which she had passed, his face immobile, twisted and
      drawn so that it resembled some sculptured mask of Pain, his eyes staring
      straight in front of him, blank and unseeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Trent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles Herrick, returning from the town to the hospital and taking, like
      every one else, the short cut across the fields, waved a friendly arm as
      he caught sight of Garth's figure silhouetted against the sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew nearer, and the set, still face of the other filled him with
      a sudden sense of dismay. There was a new look in it, a kind of dogged
      hopelessness. It entirely lacked that suggestion of austere sweetness
      which had made it so difficult to reconcile his smirched reputation with
      the man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Garth?" Instinctively Miles slipped into the more familiar
      appellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent looked at him blankly. It seemed as though he had not heard the
      question, or, at any rate, had not taken in its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say?" he muttered, his brows contracting painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles slung the various packages with which he was burdened on to the
      ground, and leaned up leisurely against the gatepost. It was
      characteristic of him that, although the day was never long enough for the
      work he crowded into it, he could always find time to give a helping hand
      to a pal with his back against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with it, man!" he said. "What's up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly recognition came back in the other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I might have anticipated," he answered, at last, in a curious flat
      voice, devoid of expression. "I've sunk a degree or two lower in Sara's
      estimation since the war broke out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles regarded him quietly for a moment, a queer, half-humorous glint in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she doesn't know you've half-beggared yourself, helping on the
      financial side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man could hardly do less, could he?" he returned awkwardly. "But if she
      did know&mdash;which she doesn't&mdash;it would make no earthly
      difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;it's because you're not soldiering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I've not volunteered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well"&mdash;composedly&mdash;"why don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your physique you could wangle the age limit," pursued Miles
      imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have to 'wangle' a good deal more than that,"&mdash;harshly.
      "Have you forgotten that I was chucked from the Army?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's such a thing as enlisting under another name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is&mdash;and then of running up against one of the old crowd and
      being recognized! It isn't so easy to lose your identity. I've had my
      lesson on that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles looked away quickly. The hard, implacable stare of the other man's
      eyes, with the blazing defiance, hurt him. It spoke too poignantly of a
      bitterness that had eaten into the heart. But he had put his hand to the
      plough, and he refused to turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't it"&mdash;he spoke with a sudden gentleness, the gentleness of
      the surgeon handling a torn limb&mdash;"wouldn't it help to straighten
      things out with Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it did, it would only make matters worse. No. Take it from me,
      Herrick, that soldiering is the one thing of all others I can't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away as though to signify that the discussion was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see it," persisted Miles. "On the contrary, it's the one thing
      that might make her believe in you. In spite of that Indian Frontier
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth swung suddenly round, a dull, dangerous gleam in his eyes. But Miles
      bore the savage glance serenely. He had applied the spur with intention.
      The other was suffering&mdash;suffering intolerably&mdash;in a dumb
      silence that shut him in alone with his agony. That silence must be
      broken, no matter what the means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd wipe out the stigma of cowardice, if you volunteered," he went on
      deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth laughed derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut it out, Herrick," he flung back. "I'm not a damned story-book hero,
      out for whitewash and the V.C."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miles continued undeterred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you'd convince Sara," he finished quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stifled exclamation broke from Garth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what end?" he burst out violently. "Can't you realize that's just the
      one thing in the world forbidden me? Sara is&mdash;oh, well, it's
      impossible to say what she is, but I suppose most good women are half
      angel. And if I gave her the smallest chance, she'd begin to believe in me
      again&mdash;to ask questions I cannot answer. . . . What's the use? I
      can't get away from the court-martial and all that followed. I can't clear
      myself. And I could never offer Sara anything more than a name that has
      been disgraced&mdash;a miserable half-life with a man who can't hold up
      his head amongst his fellows! Yes"&mdash;answering the unspoken question
      in Herrick's eyes&mdash;"I know what you're thinking&mdash;that I was
      willing to marry her once. But I believed, then, that&mdash;Garth Trent
      had cut himself free from the past. Now I know"&mdash;more quietly&mdash;"that
      there is no such thing as getting away from the mistakes one has made. . .
      . I'm tied hand and foot&mdash;every way! And it's better Sara should
      continue to think the worst of me. Then, in the future, she may find some
      sort of happiness&mdash;with Durward, perhaps." His lips greyed a little,
      but he went on. "The worse she thinks me, the easier it will be for her to
      cut me out of her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then do you mean"&mdash;Miles spoke very slowly&mdash;that you are&mdash;deliberately&mdash;holding
      back from soldiering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite deliberately!" It was like the snap of a tormented animal, baited
      beyond bearing. "If I could go with a clean name, as other men can&mdash;&mdash;Good
      God, man! Do you think I haven't thought it out&mdash;knocked my head
      against every stone wall in the whole damned business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles was silent. There was so much of truth in all Garth said, so much of
      warped vision, biased by the man's profound bitterness of soul, that he
      could find no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment Garth spoke again, jerkily, as though under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my promise to Elisabeth, as well. That binds me if I were
      recognized and taxed with my identity. I should have to hold my peace&mdash;and
      stick it all over again! . . . There's a limit to a man's endurance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a pause: "If I could go&mdash;and be sure of not returning"&mdash;grimly&mdash;"I'd
      go to-morrow&mdash;the Foreign Legion, anyway. But sometimes a man hasn't
      even the right to get himself neatly killed out of the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you driving at now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think it's plain enough! Don't you see what it would mean to
      Sara if&mdash;that&mdash;happened? She'd never believe&mdash;afterwards&mdash;that
      I'm as black as I'm painted, and I should saddle her with an intolerable
      burden of self-reproach. No, the Army is a closed door for me. . . . Damn
      it, Herrick!" with the sudden nervous violence of a man goaded past
      endurance. "Can't you understand? I ought never to have come into her life
      at all. I've only messed things up for her&mdash;damnably. The least I can
      do is to clear out of it so that she'll never regret my going. . . . I've
      gone under, and a man who's gone under had better stay there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men were silent&mdash;Trent with the bitter, brooding silence of a
      man who has battered uselessly against the bars that hem him in, and who
      at last recognizes that they can never be forced asunder, Herrick trying
      to focus his vision to that of the man beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No"&mdash;Garth spoke with a finality there was no disputing&mdash;"I've
      been buried three-and-twenty years, and my resurrection hasn't been
      exactly a success. There's no place in the world for me unless some one
      else pays the price. It's better for every one concerned that I should&mdash;stay
      buried."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      OVER THE MOUNTAINS
    </h3>
    <p>
      "He didn't do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Sara found herself saying the words aloud in the darkness and
      solitude of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her meeting with Garth, on her way to the hospital, every hour had
      been an hour of conflict. That brief, strained interview had shaken her to
      the depths of her being, and, unable to sleep when night came, she had
      lain, staring wide-eyed into the dark, struggling against its influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little enough had been said. It had been the silences, the dumb,
      passion-filled silences, vibrant with all that must not be spoken, which
      had tried her endurance to the utmost, and she had fled, at last,
      incontinently, because she had felt her resolution weakening each moment
      she and Garth remained together&mdash;because, with him beside her, the
      love against which she had been fighting for twelve long months had
      wakened into fierce life again, beating down her puny efforts to withstand
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere sound of his voice, the lightest touch of his hand, had power to
      thrill her from head to foot, to rock those barriers which his own act had
      forced her to build up between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of that one perfect moment, when the serene austerity of
      his face had given the lie to that of which he was accused, lingered with
      her, a faint elusive thread of hope which would not leave her, urging,
      suggesting, combating the hard facts to which he himself had given
      ruthless confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost without her cognizance, Sara's characteristic, vehement belief in
      whomsoever she loved&mdash;stunned at the first moment of Elisabeth's
      revelation&mdash;had been gradually creeping back to feeble, halting life,
      weakened at times by the mass of evidence arrayed against it, yet still
      alive&mdash;growing and strengthening secretly within her as an unborn
      babe grows and strengthens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since that moment on the moor, when her eyes had searched Garth's face&mdash;his
      face with the mask off&mdash;the dormant belief within her had sprung into
      conscious knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the long hours of the night she had fought against it, deeming
      it but the passionate outcome of her love for the man himself. She <i>wanted</i>
      to believe him innocent; it was only her love for him which had raised
      this phantom doubt of the charges brought against him; the wish had been
      father to the thought. So she told herself, struggling conscientiously
      against that to which she longed to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, making a mockery of the hateful thing of which he had been
      accused, her individual knowledge of Garth himself rose up and confronted
      her accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that she had ever known of him had pointed to any lack of courage.
      It had been on no sudden, splendid impulse of a moment that he had plunged
      into the sea and fought that treacherous, racing tide off Devil's Hood
      Island. Quite composedly, deliberately, he had calculated the risks&mdash;and
      taken them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, she recalled the vision of his face as she had seen it
      yesterday, in that instant before he had perceived her nearness to him&mdash;strong
      and steadfast, imprinted with a disciplined nobility&mdash;and the
      repudiation of his dishonour leapt spontaneously from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken involuntarily, the thought rushing into words before she
      was aware, and the sound of her own voice in the darkness startled her. It
      seemed almost like a voice from some Otherwhere, authoritatively assuring
      her of all she had ached to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay back on her pillows, smiling a little at the illusion. But the
      sense of peace, of blessed assuredness, remained with her. She had
      struggled through the darkness of those bitter months of unbelief, and now
      she had come out into the light on the other side. She felt dreamily
      contented and at rest, and presently she fell asleep, trustfully, as a
      little child may sleep, the smile still on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      With morning came reaction&mdash;blank, sordid reaction, depressing her
      unutterably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the score of trifling details incidental to the day's arrangements,
      with the usual uninspiring conversation prevalent at the breakfast-table
      going on around her, the mood of the previous night, informed, as it had
      been, with that triumphant sense of exaltation, slipped from her like a
      garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing she were to tell them&mdash;to tell Selwyn and Molly&mdash;that,
      without any further evidence, she was convinced of Garth's innocence? Why,
      they would think she had gone mad! Regretfully, with infinite pain it
      might be, but still none the less conclusively, they had accepted the fact
      of his guilt. And indeed, what else could be expected of them, seeing that
      he had himself acknowledged it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;that inner feeling of belief which had stirred into new life
      refused to be repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically she went about the small daily duties which made up life at
      Sunnyside&mdash;interviewed Jane Crab, read the newspapers to Mrs. Selwyn,
      accomplished the necessary shopping in the town, each and all with a mind
      that was only superficially concerned with the matter in hand, while,
      behind this screen of commonplace routine, she felt as though her soul
      were struggling impotently to release itself from the bonds which had
      bound it in a tyranny of anguish for twelve long months.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, she paid a visit to the Convalescent Hospital. She made
      a practice of going there at least once a day and giving what assistance
      she could. Frequently she relieved Miles of part of his secretarial work,
      or checked through with him the invoices of goods received. There were
      always plenty of odd jobs to be done, and, after her strenuous work in
      France, she found it utterly impossible to settle down to the life of
      masterly inactivity which Selwyn had prescribed for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey greeted her with a little flurry of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know that there was a Zepp over Oldhampton last night?" she asked,
      as they went upstairs together. "Did you hear it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shook her head. The memory of the previous night surged over her like
      the memory of a vivid dream&mdash;the absolute assurance it had brought
      her of Garth's innocence, an assurance which had grown vague and doubtful
      with the daylight, just as the happenings of a dream grow blurred and
      indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't hear anything," she replied absently. "Did they do much
      damage? I suppose they were after the munitions factory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. They dropped one bomb, that's all. It fell in a field, luckily. But
      goodness knows how they got over without any one's spotting them!
      Everybody's asking where our search-lights were. As for our anti-aircraft
      guns, they've never had the opportunity yet to do anything more than try
      our nerves by practicing! And last night a golden opportunity came and
      went unobserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The milkman was babbling to Jane about Zeppelins this morning, but I
      thought it was probably only the result of overnight potations at 'The
      Jolly Sailorman.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it was the real thing&mdash;'made in Germany,'" smiled Audrey. "I
      begin to feel as if we were quite the hub of the universe, now that the
      Zepps have acknowledged our existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused outside the door of the room allotted to her husband's
      activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miles will be glad to see you to-day," she pursued. "He's bemoaning a new
      manifestation of war-fever among the feminine population of Monkshaven. Go
      in to him, will you? I must run off&mdash;I've got a million things to see
      to. You're not looking very fit to-day"&mdash;suddenly observing the
      other's white face and shadowed eyes. "Are you feeling up to work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara nodded indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," she said. "I shouldn't have come otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles welcomed her joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, my dear!" he exclaimed. "You're the very woman I wanted to
      see. I'm snowed under with fool letters from females anxious to entertain
      'our poor, brave, wounded officers.' Head 'em off, will you?" He thrust a
      bundle of letters into her hands. Then, as she moved toward the windows,
      and the cold, searching light of the wintry sunshine fell full on her
      face, his voice altered. "What is it? What has happened, Sara?" he asked
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him dumbly. Her lips moved, but no sound came. The sudden
      question, accompanied by the swift, penetrating glance of Miles's brown
      eyes, had taken her off her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He limped across to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a stroke of work for you to-day," he said decisively, taking the
      bundle of letters out of her hands. "Now tell me what's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away from him, a slow, shamed red creeping into her face. At
      last&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen Garth," she said very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick nodded. He knew what that meeting had meant to one of these two
      friends of his. Now he was to see the reverse of the medal. He waited, his
      silence sympathetic and far more helpful than any eager, probing question,
      however well-intentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miles," she burst out suddenly, "I'm&mdash;I'm wretched!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" He did not make the mistake of attributing her outburst to a
      transient mood of depression. Something deeper lay behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I saw Garth yesterday I've been asking myself whether&mdash;whether
      I've been doing him a ghastly injustice"&mdash;she moistened her dry lips&mdash;"whether
      he was really guilty of&mdash;running away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" Miles stuffed his hands in his pockets and limped the length of the
      room and back. In that moment, he realized something of the maddening,
      galling restraint of the bondage under which Garth Trent had lived for
      years&mdash;the bondage of silence, and, within his pickets, his hands
      were clenched when he halted again at Sara's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" he shot at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Then she caught her breath a little hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;because&mdash;because I just can't believe it! . . . I've seen
      a lot since I went away. I've seen brave men&mdash;and I've seen men . . .
      who were afraid." She turned her head aside. "They&mdash;the ones who were
      afraid&mdash;didn't look . . . as Garth looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herrick made no comment. He put a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I expect you think I'm a fool? I've nothing to go on&mdash;on
      the contrary, I've Garth's own admission that&mdash;that he <i>was</i>
      cashiered. And yet&mdash;&mdash;Oh! Miles, if he were only doing anything&mdash;now&mdash;it
      would be easier to believe in him! But&mdash;he holds absolutely aloof.
      It's as though he <i>were</i> afraid&mdash;still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever thought"&mdash;Herrick spoke slowly, without looking at her&mdash;"what
      this year of war must have meant to a man who has been a soldier&mdash;and
      is one no longer?" His eyes came back to her face meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How&mdash;what do you mean?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've only got to look at the man to know what I mean. I think&mdash;since
      the war broke out&mdash;that Trent has been through the bitterness of
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but he could have enlisted&mdash;got in somehow&mdash;under
      another name, had he <i>wanted</i> to fight. Or he might have gone out and
      driven an ambulance car&mdash;as Lester Kent did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was putting to Herrick the very arguments which had arisen in her own
      mind to confound the intuitive belief of which she had been conscious
      since that moment of inward revelation on Crabtree Moor&mdash;putting them
      forward in all their repulsive ugliness of fact, in the desperate hope
      that Herrick might find some way to refute them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some men might have done, perhaps," answered Miles quietly. "But not a
      man of Trent's temperament. Some trees bend in a storm&mdash;and when the
      worst of it is past, they spring erect again. Some <i>can't</i>; they
      break."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words recalled to Sara's mind with sudden vividness the last letter
      Patrick Lovell had ever written her&mdash;the one which he had left in the
      Chippendale bureau for her to receive after his death. He had applied
      almost those identical words to the Malincourt temperament, of which he
      had recognized the share she had inherited. And she realized that her
      guardian and Miles Herrick had been equally discerning. Though differing
      in its effect upon each of them, consequent upon individual idiosyncrasy,
      the fact remained that she and Garth were both "breaking" beneath the
      strain which destiny had imposed on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the memory of Patrick's letter came an inexpressible longing for the
      man himself&mdash;for the kindly, helping hand which he would have
      stretched out to her in this crisis of her life. She felt sure that, had
      he been beside her now, his shrewd counsel would have cleared away the
      mists of doubt and indecision which had closed about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since he was no longer there to be appealed to, she had turned
      instinctively to Herrick, and, somehow, he had failed her. He had not
      given her a definite expression of his own belief. She had been humanly
      craving to hear that he, too, believed in Garth, notwithstanding the
      evidence against him&mdash;that he had some explanation to offer of that
      ghastly tragedy of the court-martial episode. And instead, he had only
      hazarded some tolerant suggestions&mdash;sympathetic to Garth, it is true,
      but not carrying with them the vital, unqualified assurance she had longed
      to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this, she knew that Herrick's friendship with Garth had
      remained unbroken by the knowledge of the Indian Frontier story. The
      personal relations of the two men were unchanged, and she felt as though
      Miles were withholding something from her, observing a reticence for which
      she could find no explanation. He had been very kind and understanding&mdash;it
      would not have been Miles had he been otherwise&mdash;but he had not
      helped her much. In some curious way she felt as though he had thrown the
      whole onus of coming to a decision, unaided by advice, upon her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Sunnyside oppressed with a homesick longing for Patrick.
      The two years which had elapsed since his death had blunted the edge of
      her sorrow&mdash;as time inevitably must&mdash;but she still missed the
      shrewd, kindly, worldly-wise old man unspeakably, and just now, thrown
      back upon herself in some indefinable way by Miles's attitude, her whole
      heart cried out for that other who was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if he knew how much she needed him. She almost believed that
      he must know&mdash;wherever he might be now, she felt that Patrick would
      never have forgotten the child of the woman whom, in this world, he had
      loved so long and faithfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an instinctive craving for some tangible memory of him, she unlocked
      the leather case which held her mother's miniature, together with the last
      letter which Patrick had ever written; and, unfolding the letter, began to
      read it once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, there seemed comfort in the very wording of it, in every little
      characteristic phrase that had been Patrick's, in the familiar
      appellation, "Little old pal," which he had kept for her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once her fingers gripped the letter more tightly, her attentions
      riveted by a certain passage towards the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . And when love comes to you, never forget that it is the biggest
      thing in the world, the one altogether good and perfect gift. Don't let
      any twopenny-halfpenny considerations of worldly advantage influence you,
      or the tittle-tattle of other folks, and even if it seems that something
      unsurmountable lies between you and the fulfillment of love, go over it,
      or round it, or through it! If it's real love, your faith must be big
      enough to remove the mountains in the way&mdash;or to go over them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Patrick foreseen the exact circumstances in which his "little old pal"
      would one day find herself, he could not have written anything more
      strangely applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara sat still, every nerve of her taut and strung. She felt as though she
      had laid bare the whole of her trouble, revealed her inmost soul in all
      its anguished perplexity, to those shrewd blue eyes which had been wont to
      see so clearly through externals, piercing infallibly to the very heart of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick had always possessed that supreme gift of being able to separate
      the grain from the chaff&mdash;to distinguish unerringly between
      essentials and non-essentials, and now, in the quiet, wise counsel of an
      old letter, Sara found an answer to all the questionings that had made so
      bitter a thing of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost as if some one had torn down a curtain from before her eyes,
      rent asunder a veil which had been distorting and obscuring the values of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountains! There were mountains indeed betwixt her and Garth&mdash;and
      there was no way round them or through them! But now&mdash;now she would
      go over them&mdash;go straight ahead, unregarding of the mountains
      between, to where Garth and love awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man is all angel&mdash;or all devil. Supposing Garth <i>had</i> been
      guilty of cowardice, had had his one moment of weakness? She no longer
      cared! He was hers, her lover, alike in his weakness and in his strength.
      She had known men in France shrink in terror at the evil droning of a
      shell, and then die selflessly that others might live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your faith must be big enough to remove the mountains in the way&mdash;or
      to go over them," Patrick had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sara, hiding her face in her hands, thanked God that now, at last, her
      faith was big enough, and that love&mdash;"the one altogether good and
      perfect gift"&mdash;was still hers if she would only go over the
      mountains.

      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      "GARTH TRENT, COWARD."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, in staring white capital letters, had been chalked up by some
      one on the big wooden double-doors that shut the world out from Far End.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara stood quite still, gazing at them fixedly, and a tense white-heat of
      anger flared up within her. Who had dared to put such an insult upon the
      man she loved?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Coward</i>!" No one had ever actually applied that term to Garth in
      her hearing. They had skirted delicately round it, or wrapped up its
      meaning in some less harsh-sounding tangle of phrases, and although she
      had bitterly used the word herself, now that the opprobrious expression
      publicly confronted her, writ large by some unfriendly hand, she was swept
      by a sheer fury of indignant denial. It roused in her the immediate
      instinct to defend, to range herself unmistakably on Garth's side against
      a world of traducers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a faint smile of self-mockery, she realized that had this flagrant
      insult been leveled at him in the beginning, had her first knowledge of
      the black shadow which hung over him been thus brutally flung at her,
      instead of diffidently, reluctantly broken to her by Elisabeth, she would
      probably, with the instinctive partisanship of woman for her mate, have
      utterly refused to credit it&mdash;against all reason and all proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered who could have done this ting, nailed this insult to Garth's
      very door. The illiterate characters stamped it as the work of some one in
      the lower walks of life, and, with a frown of annoyance, Sara promptly&mdash;and
      quite correctly&mdash;ascribed it to Black Brady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never forgits to pay back," he had told her once, belligerently.
      Probably this was his notion of getting even with the man who had
      prosecuted him for poaching. But had Brady realized that, in retaliating
      upon Trent, he would be giving pain to his beloved Sara, whom he had grown
      to regard with a humble, dog-like devotion, he would certainly have
      refrained from recording his vengeance upon Garth's gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surmising that Garth could not have seen the offending legend&mdash;or it
      would scarcely have been left for all who can to read&mdash;Sara whipped
      out her handkerchief and set to work to rub it off. He should not see it
      if she could help it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Black Brady had done his work very thoroughly, and she was still
      diligently scrubbing at it with an inadequate piece of cambric when she
      heard steps behind her, and wheeling round, found herself confronted by
      Garth himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes rested indifferently and without surprise upon the chalked-up
      words, then turned to Sara's face inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you doing that?" he asked. "Is&mdash;cleaning gates the latest
      form of war-work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara, her face scarlet, answered reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't want you to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious expression flashed into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw it&mdash;two hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you left it there?"&mdash;with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? It's true, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And in that moment the long struggle in Sara's heart ended, and she
      answered out of the fullness of the faith that was in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! It is <i>not</i> true! I've been a fool to believe it for an instant.
      But I'm one no longer. I don't believe it." She paused, then, very
      deliberately and steadily, she put her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth&mdash;tell me, were you ever guilty of cowardice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The court-martial thought so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's foot tapped impatiently on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please answer my question," she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elisabeth Durward has surely supplied you with all the information on
      that subject which you require," he said in expressionless tones, and Sara
      was conscious anew of the maddening feeling of impotence with which a
      contest of wills between herself and Garth never failed to imbue her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth"&mdash;there was appeal in her voice, yet it was still very steady
      and determined&mdash;"I want to know what <i>you</i> say about it. What
      Elisabeth&mdash;or any one else&mdash;may say, doesn't matter any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the quiet depth of emotion in her voice momentarily broke
      through his guard. He made an involuntary movement towards her, then
      checked himself, and, with an effort, resumed his former detached manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More important than anything either I, or Elisabeth, can say, is the
      verdict of the court," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deadly calm of his voice ripped away her last remnant of composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The verdict of the court!" she burst out. "<i>Damn</i> the verdict of the
      court!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done&mdash;many a time!"&mdash;bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth," she came a step nearer to him and her sombre eyes blazed into
      his. "I <i>will</i> have an answer! For God's sake, don't fence with me
      any longer! . . . There have been misunderstandings enough, reticences
      enough, between us. For this once, let us be honest with each other. I
      pretended I didn't care&mdash;I pretended I could go on living, believing
      you to be what&mdash;what they have called you. And I can't! . . . I can't
      go on. . . . I can't bear it any longer. You must answer me! <i>Were you
      guilty?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was white to the lips by the time she had finished, and his eyes held a
      look of dumb torture. Twice he essayed to answer her, but no sound came.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he turned away, as though the passionate question in her face&mdash;the
      eager, hungry longing to hear her faith confirmed&mdash;were more than he
      could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot deny it." The words came hoarsely, almost whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes never left his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't ask you to deny it," she persisted doggedly. "I asked you&mdash;were
      you guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there fell as heavy silence. Then, reluctantly, as if the admission
      were dragged from him, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I can give you no other answer to that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light like the tender, tremulous shining of dawn broke across Sara's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you <i>weren't</i> guilty!" she exclaimed, and there was a deep,
      surpassing joy in her shaken tones. "I knew it! I was sure of it. Oh!
      Garth, Garth, what a fool I've been! And oh! My dear, why did you do it?
      Why did you let me go on thinking you&mdash;what it almost killed me to
      think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared down at her with wondering, uncertain eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I've just told you that I can't deny it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him&mdash;a smile of absolute content, with a gleam of
      humour at the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't ask you to deny it. I asked you to own to it; I tried to make
      you&mdash;every way. And you can't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand across his mouth&mdash;laughing the tender, triumphant
      laughter of a woman who has won, and knows that she has.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't blacken yourself any longer on my account, Garth. I shall
      never again believe anything that you may say against&mdash;the man I
      love."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood leaning a little towards him, surrender in every line of her
      slender body, and her face was like a white flame&mdash;transfigured,
      radiant with some secret, mystic glory of love's imparting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an inarticulate cry he opened wide his arms and she went to him&mdash;swiftly,
      unerringly, like a homing bird&mdash;and, as he folded her close against
      his breast and laid his lips to hers, all the hunger and the longing of
      the empty past was in his kiss. For the moment, pain and bitterness and
      regret were swept away in that ecstasy of reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, with a little sigh of spent rapture, she leaned away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think we've wasted a whole year," she said regretfully. "Garth, I wish
      I had trusted you better!" There was a sweet humility of repentance in her
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why you should trust me now," he rejoined quietly. "The facts
      remain as before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that the verdict of the court-martial was wrong," she said swiftly.
      "There was some horrible mistake. I am sure of it&mdash;I know it! Garth!"&mdash;after
      a moment's pause&mdash;"are you going to tell me everything? I have the
      right to know&mdash;haven't I?&mdash;now that I'm going to be your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the clasp of his arms relax, and, looking up quickly, she saw his
      face suddenly revert to its old lines of weariness. Slowly, reluctantly,
      he drew away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth!" There was a shrilling note of apprehension in her voice. "Garth!
      What is it? Why do you look like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a full minute before he answered. When he did, he spoke heavily, as
      one who knows that his next words will dash all the joy out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," he said quietly, "I can no more tell you anything now than I
      could before. I can't clear myself, Sara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean&mdash;you will <i>never</i> be able to?" she asked
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I mean that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me one more question, Garth. Is it that you <i>cannot</i>&mdash;or
      <i>will not</i> clear yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>must</i> not," he replied steadily. "I am not the only one concerned
      in the matter. There is some one to whom I owe it to be silent. Honour
      forbids that I should even try to clear myself. Now you know all&mdash;all
      that I can ever tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it?" The question leaped from her, and Garth's answer came with an
      irrevocability of refusal there was no combating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I cannot tell you&mdash;or any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's mouth twitched. Her face was very white, but her eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have borne this&mdash;all these years?" she said. "You have known
      that you could clear yourself and have refrained?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no choice," he answered quietly. "I took on a certain liability&mdash;years
      ago, and because it has turned out to be a much heavier liability than I
      anticipated gives me no excuse for repudiating it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Sara hid her face in her hands. When she uncovered it again
      there was something almost akin to awe in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ever forgive me, Garth, for doubting you?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive you?" He smiled. "What else could you have done, sweetheart? I
      don't know, even now, why you believe in me," he added wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because&mdash;" she began, and fell silent, realizing that her
      belief had no reason, but was founded on the intuitive knowledge of a love
      that has suffered and won out on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next she spoke it was with the simple, frank directness
      characteristic of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God that I can prove that I do trust you&mdash;absolutely. When
      will you marry me, Garth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will I marry you?" He repeated the words slowly, as though they
      conveyed no meaning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I want every one to know, to see that I believe in you. I want to
      stand at your side&mdash;go shares. Do you remember, once, how we settled
      that married life meant going shares in everything&mdash;good and bad?"
      She smiled a little at the remembrance drawn from the small store of
      memories that was all her few days of unclouded love had given her. "I
      want&mdash;my share, Garth."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he was silent. Then he spoke, and the quiet finality of his
      tones struck her like a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can never marry, Sara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never&mdash;marry!" she repeated dazedly. Quick fear seized her, and she
      rushed on impetuously: "Then you haven't forgiven me, after all&mdash;you
      don't believe that I trust you! Oh! How can I make you <i>know</i> that I
      do? Garth&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear," he interrupted swiftly. "Don't misunderstand me. I know
      that you believe in me now&mdash;and I thank God for it! And as for
      forgiveness, as I told you, I have nothing to forgive. You'd have had need
      of the faith that removes mountains"&mdash;Sara started at the repetition
      of Patrick's very words&mdash;"to have believed in me under the
      circumstances." He paused a moment, and when he spoke again there was
      something triumphant in his tones&mdash;a serene gladness and contentment.
      "You and I, beloved, are right with each other&mdash;now and always.
      Nothing can ever again come between us to divide us as we have been
      divided this last year. But, none the less," and his voice took on a
      steadfast note of resolve, "I cannot marry you. I thought I could&mdash;I
      thought the past had sunk into oblivion, and that I might take the gift of
      love you offered me. . . . But I was wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No! You were not wrong!" She was clinging to him in a sudden terror
      that even now their happiness was slipping from them. "The past has
      nothing to say to you and me. It can't come between us. . . . You have
      only to take me, Garth"&mdash;tremulously. "Let me <i>show</i> that my
      love is stronger than ill repute. Let me come to you and stand by you as
      your wife. The past can't hurt us, then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The past never loses its power to hurt," he answered. "I've learned that.
      As far as the world you belong to is concerned, I'm finished, and I won't
      drag the woman I love through the same hell I've been through. That's what
      it would mean, you know. You would be singled out, pointed at, as the wife
      of a man who was chucked out of the Service. There would be no place in
      the world for you. You would be ostracized&mdash;because you were my
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't care," she urged. "Surely I can bear&mdash;what you have
      borne? . . . I shouldn't mind&mdash;anything&mdash;so long as we were
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her close to him, his lips against her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beloved!" he said, a great wonder in his voice. "Oh! Little <i>brave</i>
      thing! What have I ever done that you should love me like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara winked away a tear, and a rather tremulous smile hovered round her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I'm sure," she acknowledged a little shakily. "But I do.
      Garth, you <i>will</i> marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his bent head, his eyes gazing straight ahead of him, as though
      envisioning the lonely future and defying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said resolutely. "No. God helping me, I will never marry you,
      Sara. I have&mdash;no right to marry. It could only bring you misery.
      Dear, I must shield you, even from yourself&mdash;from your own big,
      generous impulses which would let you join your life to mine. . . . Love
      is denied to us&mdash;denied through my own act of long ago. But if you'll
      give me friendship. . . ." She could sense the sudden passionate entreaty
      behind the words. "Sara! Friendship is worth while&mdash;such friendship
      as ours would be! Are you brave enough, strong enough, to give me that&mdash;since
      I may not ask for more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, while Sara lay very still against his breast,
      her face hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that silence, her spirit met and faced the ultimate issue&mdash;for
      there was that in Garth's voice which told her that his decision not to
      marry her was immutable. Could she&mdash;oh God!&mdash;could she give him
      what he asked? Give only part to the man to whom she longed to give all
      that a woman has to give? It would be far easier to go away&mdash;to put
      him out of her life for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;he asked this of her! He needed something that she could
      still give&mdash;the comradeship which was all that they two might ever
      know of love. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she raised her face to his, it was ashen, but her small chin
      was out-thrust, her eyes were like stars, and the grip of her slim hands
      on his shoulders was as iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm strong enough to give you anything that you want," she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made the supreme sacrifice; she was ready to be his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sad and wistful gravity hung about their parting. Their lips met and
      clung together, but it was in a kiss of renunciation, not of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her in his arms a moment longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never forget I'm loving you&mdash;always," he said steadily. "Call me
      your friend&mdash;but remember, in my heart I shall always be your lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his, unflinching, infinitely faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I&mdash;I, too, shall be loving you," she answered, simply. "Always,
      Garth&mdash;always."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      OUT OF THE NIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tim was home on sick leave, and, after two perfect weeks of reunion,
      Elisabeth had written to ask if he might come down to Sunnyside,
      suggesting that the sea-breezes might advance his convalescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder Mrs. Durward cares to spare him," commented Selwyn in some
      surprise. "It seems out of keeping with her general attitude. However, we
      shall be delighted to have him here. Write and say so, will you, Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara acquiesced briefly, flushing a little. She thought she could read the
      motive at the back of Elisabeth's proposal&mdash;the spirit which, putting
      up a gallant fight even in the very face of defeat, could make yet a final
      effort to secure success by throwing Tim and the woman he loved together
      in the dangerously seductive intimacy of the same household.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sara had no fear that Tim would avail himself of the opportunity thus
      provided in the way Elisabeth doubtless hoped he might. That matter had
      been finally settled between herself and him before he went to France, and
      she knew that he would never again ask her to be his wife. So she wrote to
      him serenely, telling him to come down to Monkshaven as soon as he liked;
      and a few days later found him installed at Sunnyside, nominally under Dr.
      Selwyn's care.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the same unaffected, spontaneous Tim as of yore, and hugely
      embarrassed by any reference to his winning of the Military Cross, firmly
      refusing to discuss the manner of it, even with Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just got on with my job&mdash;like dozens of other fellows," was all he
      would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from a brother officer that Sara learned, later, than Tim had "got
      on with his job" under a hellish enemy fire, in spite of being twice
      wounded; and had thus saved the immediate situation in his vicinity&mdash;and,
      incidentally, the lives of many of his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to Sara to have become at once both older and younger than in
      former days. He had all the hilarious good spirits evinced by nine out of
      ten of the boys who came home on leave&mdash;the cheery capacity to laugh
      at the hardships and dangers of the front, to poke good-natured fun at
      "old Fritz" and to make a jest of the German shells and the Flanders mud,
      treating the whole great adventure of war as though it were the finest
      game invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet back of the mirth and laughter in the blue eyes lurked something new
      and strange and grave&mdash;inexpressibly touching&mdash;that indefinable
      something which one senses shrinkingly in the young eyes of the boys who
      have come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hurt Sara somehow&mdash;that look of which she caught glimpses now and
      then, in quiet moments, and she set herself to drive it away, or, at
      least, to keep it at bay as much as possible, by filling every available
      moment with occupation or amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want him to think about what it was like&mdash;out there," she
      told Molly. "His eyes make my heart ache, sometimes. They're too young to
      have seen&mdash;such things. Suggest something we can play at to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So they threw themselves, heart and soul, into the task of entertaining
      Tim, and, since he was very willing to be entertained, the weeks at
      Sunnyside slipped by in a little whirl of gaiety, winding up with a
      badminton tournament, at which Tim&mdash;whose right arm had not yet quite
      recovered from the effects of the German bullet it had stopped&mdash;played
      a left-handed game, and triumphantly maneuvered himself and his partner
      into the semi-finals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably&mdash;leniently handicapped, as they were, in the circumstances&mdash;they
      would have won the tournament, but that, unluckily, in leaping to reach a
      shuttle soaring high above his head, Tim somehow missed his footing and
      came down heavily, with his leg twisted underneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broken ankle," announced Selwyn briefly, when he had made his
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim opened his eyes&mdash;he had lost consciousness, momentarily, from the
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" he observed succinctly. "That'll make it the very devil of a time
      before I can get back to France!" Then, to Sara, who could be heard
      murmuring something about writing to Elisabeth: "Not much, old thing, you
      don't! She'd fuss herself, no end. Just write&mdash;and say&mdash;it's a
      sprain." And he promptly fainted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got him back to Sunnyside while he was still unconscious, and when he
      returned to an intelligent understanding of material matters, he found
      himself in bed, with a hump-like excrescence in front of him keeping the
      weight of the bedclothes from the injured limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I faint?" he asked morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Lucky you did, too," responded Sara cheerfully. "Doctor Dick rigged
      your ankle up all nice and comfy without your being any the wiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fainted&mdash;like a girl&mdash;over a broken ankle, my hat!"&mdash;with
      immense scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was hard put to it not to laugh outright at his face of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might remember that you're not strong yet," she suggested soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked for a little, and presently Tim, whose eyelids had been
      blinking somnolently for some time, gave vent to an unmistakable yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm&mdash;I'm confoundedly sleepy," he murmured apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go to sleep," came promptly from Sara. "It's quite the best thing
      you can do. I'll run off and write a judicious letter to Elisabeth&mdash;about
      your sprain"&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glance round to see that he had candle, matches, and a hand-bell
      within reach, she turned out the lamp and slipped quietly away. Tim was
      asleep almost before she had quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several hours later when Sara sat up in bed, broad awake, in
      response to the vigorous shaking that some one was administering to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes to the yellow glare of a candle. Behind the glare
      materialized a vision of Jane Crab, attired in a red flannel
      dressing-gown, and with her hair tightly strained into four skimpy plaits
      which stuck out horizontally from her head like the surviving rays of a
      badly damaged halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Sara! Miss Sara!" She apostrophized the rudely awakened sleeper in a
      sibilant whisper, as though afraid of being overheard. "Get up, quick!
      They 'Uns is 'ere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Who</i> is here?" exclaimed Sara, somewhat startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Zepps, miss&mdash;the Zepps! The guns are firing off every minute or
      two. There!"&mdash;as the blurred thunder of anti-aircraft guns boomed in
      the distance. "There they go again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara leaped out of bed in an instant, hastily pulling on a fascinating
      silk kimono and thrusting her bare feet into a pair of scarlet Turkish
      slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One may as well die tidy," she reflected philosophically. Then, turning
      to Jane&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the doctor?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying to get the mistress downstairs. She's that scared, she won't budge
      from her bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara giggled&mdash;Jane's face was very expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm going into Mr. Durward's room," she announced. "We shall see
      better there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's little beady eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, I'd like to see them at their devil's work," she allowed fondly,
      with a threatening "Just-let-me-catch-them-at-it!" intonation in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed, and they both repaired to Tim's room, encountering Molly on
      the way and sweeping her along in their train. They found Tim volubly
      cursing his inability to get up and "watch the fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out and tell me if you can see the blighters," he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sara threw open the window, a dull, thudding sound came up to them from
      the direction of Oldhampton. There was a sullen menace in the
      distance-dulled reverberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly gurgled with the nervous excitement of a first experience under
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a bomb!" she whispered breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, and Sara, and Jane Crab wedged themselves together in the open window
      and leaned far out, peering into the moonless dark. As they watched, a
      search-light leapt into being, and a pencil of light moved flickeringly
      across the sky. Then another and another&mdash;sweeping hither and thither
      like the blind feelers of some hidden octopus seeking its prey. There was
      something horribly uncanny in those long, straight shafts of light
      wavering uncertainly across the dense darkness of the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you see the Zepp?" demanded Tim, with lively interest, from his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's pitch black&mdash;too dark to see a thing," replied Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly as she spoke, a brilliant light hung for a moment suspended in the
      dark arch of the sky, then shivered into a blaze of garish effulgence,
      girdling the countryside and illuminating every road and building, every
      field, and tree, and ditch, as brightly as though it were broad daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A star-shell!" gasped Molly. "What a beastly thing! Positively"&mdash;giggling
      nervously&mdash;"I believe they can see right inside this room!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tisn't decent!" fulminated Jane indignantly, clutching with modest
      fingers at her scanty dressing-gown and straining it tightly across her
      chest whilst she backed hastily from the vicinity of the window. "Lightin'
      up sudden like that in the middle of the night! I feel for all the world
      as though I hadn't got a stitch on me! Come away from the window, do, miss&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The light failed as suddenly as it had flared, and a warning crash,
      throbbing up against their ears, startled her into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a trifle too near to be pleasant," exclaimed Tim sharply. "Go
      downstairs, you three! Do you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, Selwyn shouted from below&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come downstairs! Come down at once! Quick, Sara! I'm coming up to carry
      Tim down&mdash;and Minnie won't stay alone. Come <i>on</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to something urgent and imperative in the voices of both men&mdash;something
      that breathed of danger&mdash;the three women hastened from the room.
      Jane's candle flared and went out in the draught from the suddenly opened
      door, and in the smothering darkness they stumbled pell-mell down the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dim light burning in the hall showed them Mrs. Selwyn cowering against
      her husband, her face hidden, sobbing hysterically, and in a moment Sara
      had taken Dick's place, wrapping her strong arms about the shuddering
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on!" she whispered to him. "Go and get Tim down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, releasing himself with gentle force from his wife's clinging
      fingers, which had closed upon his arm like a vise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she lifted up her voice in a thin, querulous shriek&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Dick, Dick&mdash;don't leave me! <i>Dick</i>"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . And then it came&mdash;sped from that hovering Hate which hung above&mdash;dropping
      soundlessly, implacable through the utter darkness of the night and
      crashing into devilish life against a corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by a terrible flash and roar&mdash;a chaos of unimaginable sound.
      It seemed as though the whole world had split into fragments and were
      rocketing off into space; and, in quick succession, came the rumble of
      falling beams and masonry, and the dense dust of disintegrated plaster
      mingling with the fumes of high explosive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara was conscious of being shot violently across the hall, and then
      everything went out in illimitable black darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "FROM SUDDEN DEATH&mdash;&mdash;"
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Sara! Sara! For God's sake, open your eyes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The anguished tones pierced through the black curtain which had suddenly
      cut away the outer world from Sara's consciousness, and she opened her
      eyes obediently, to find herself looking straight into Garth's face bent
      above her&mdash;a sickly white in the yellow glare of the hurricane lamp
      he was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hurt?" His voice came again insistently, sharp with hideous fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up, breathing rather fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, as though surprised. "I'm not hurt&mdash;not the least
      bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Garth's help, she struggled to her feet and stood upright&mdash;rather
      shakily, it is true, but still able to accomplish the feat without much
      difficulty. She began to laugh weakly&mdash;a little helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think&mdash;I think I've only had my wind knocked out," she said. Then,
      as gradually the comprehension of events returned to her: "The others?
      Who's hurt? Oh, Garth! Is any one&mdash;<i>killed</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no one, thank God!" He reassured her hastily. His arm went round her,
      and for a moment their lips met in a silent passion of thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you&mdash;how did you come here?" she asked, as they drew apart once
      more. "You . . . weren't . . . here?"&mdash;her brows contracting in a
      puzzled frown as she endeavoured to recall the incidents immediately
      preceding the bombing of the house. "We'd&mdash;we'd just gone to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was dining with the Herricks. The raid began just as I was leaving
      them, so Judson and I drove straight on here instead of going home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara pressed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, dear!" she whispered quickly. Then, recollection returning
      more completely: "Tim? Is Tim safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim?"&mdash;sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was upstairs. Where is Doctor Dick? Did he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not far off," came Selwyn's voice, from the mouth of a dark cavity
      that had once been the study doorway. "Come over here&mdash;but step
      carefully. The floor's strewn with stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth piloted Sara skillfully across the debris that littered the floor,
      and they joined the group of shadowy figures huddled together in the
      doorless study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ware my arm!" warned Selwyn, as they approached. "It's broken, confound
      it!" He seemed, for the moment, oblivious of the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Selwyn, finding herself physically intact, was keeping up
      an irritating moaning, interspersed with pettish diatribes against a
      Government that could be so culpably careless as to permit her to be
      bombed out of house and home; whilst Jane Crab, who had found and lit a
      candle, and recklessly stuck it to the table in its own grease, was
      bluffly endeavouring to console her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Selwyn's saint-like patience failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shut up whining, Minnie!" he exclaimed forcefully. "It would be more
      to the point if you got down on your knees and said thank you to some one
      or something instead of grousing like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned hurriedly to Garth, who was flashing his lantern hither and
      thither, locating the damage done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here," he said. "Young Durward's upstairs. We must get him down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does he sleep? One side of the house is staved in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not that side, thank Heaven! But the odds are he's badly hurt. And,
      anyway, he's helpless. I was just going up to carry him down when that
      damned bomb got us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth swung out into the hall and sent a ringing shout up through the
      house. An instant later Tim's answer floated down to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All serene! Can't move!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Garth sent his voice pealing upwards&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on! We'll be with you in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Selwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up," he said. "You can't do anything with that arm of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can help," maintained Dick stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. If you slipped amongst the mess there'll be up there, I'd have two
      cripples on my hands instead of one. You stay here and look after the
      women&mdash;and get one of them to fix you up a temporary splint."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men moved forward, the women pressing eagerly behind them; then,
      as the light from Garth's lantern steamed ahead there came an
      instantaneous outcry of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole stairway was twisted and askew. It had a ludicrously drunken
      look, as though it were lolling up against the wall&mdash;like a staircase
      in a picture of which the perspective is all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't safe!" exclaimed Selwyn quickly. "You can't go up. We shall have
      to wait till help comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going up&mdash;now," said Garth quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it isn't safe, man! Those stairs won't bear you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll have to"&mdash;laconically. "That top story may go at any minute.
      It would collapse like a pack of cards if another bomb fell near enough
      for us to feel the concussion. And young Durward would have about as much
      chance as a rat in a trap."
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence descended on the little group of anxious people as he finished
      speaking. The gravity of Tim's position suddenly revealed itself&mdash;and
      the danger involved by an attempt at rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara drew close to Garth's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Must</i> you go, Garth?" she asked. "Wouldn't it be safe to wait till
      help comes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tim isn't <i>safe</i> there, actually five minutes. The floors may hold&mdash;or
      they mayn't! I must go, sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his hand and held it an instant against her cheek. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, dear," she whispered. "Go quickly. And oh!&mdash;God keep you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone, picking his way gingerly, treading as lightly as a cat, so
      that the wrenched stairway hardly creaked beneath his swift, lithe steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once there came the sudden rattle of some falling scrap of broken plaster,
      and Sara, leaning with closed eyes and white, set face, against the
      framework of a doorway, shivered soundlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he had disappeared round the distorted head of the staircase, and
      those who were watching could only discern the bobbing glimmer of the
      light he carried mounting higher and higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;after an interminable time, it seemed&mdash;there came the
      sound of voices . . . he had found Tim . . . a pause . . . then again a
      short, quick speech and the word "Right?" drifted faintly down to the
      strained ears below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously Sara's hands had clenched themselves, and the nails were
      biting into the flesh of her palms. But she felt no pain. Her whole being
      seemed concentrated into the single sense of hearing as she waited there
      in the candle-lit gloom, listening for every tiny sound, each creak of a
      board, each scattering of loosened plaster, which might herald danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another eternity crawled by before, at length, Garth reappeared once more
      round the last bend of the staircase. Tim was lying across his shoulder,
      his injured leg hanging stiffly down, and in his hand he grasped the
      lantern, while both Garth's arms supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes had opened now and fixed themselves intently on the burdened
      figure of the man she loved, as, with infinite caution, he began the
      descent of the last flight of stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a double strain now upon the dislocated boards and joists&mdash;the
      weight of two men where one had climbed before with lithe, light,
      unimpeded limbs&mdash;and it seemed to Sara's tense, set vision as if a
      slight tremor ran throughout the whole stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an agony of terror she watched Garth's steady, downward progress. She
      felt as though she must scream out to him to hurry&mdash;<i>hurry</i>! Yet
      she bit back the scream lest it should startle him, every muscle of her
      body rigid with the effort that her silence cost her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven stairs more! Six!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's lips were moving voicelessly. She was whispering rapidly over and
      over again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "God! God! God! Keep him safe! . . . You can do it. . . . Don't let him
      fall. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Five! Only five steps more!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold up the stairs! . . . God! <i>Don't</i> let them give way! . . .
      Don't&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there came the familiar thudding sound of an explosion. Somewhere
      another bomb, hurled from the cavernous dark that hid the enemy, had
      fallen, and almost simultaneously, it seemed, a warning thunder rumbled
      overhead like the menacing growl of a wild beast suddenly let loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first low mutter of that threat of imminent disaster, Garth sprang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gripping Tim firmly in his arms, he leaped from the quaking staircase,
      falling awkwardly, prone beneath the burden of the other's helpless body,
      as he landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as he reached the ground, the upper story of the house, with a
      roar that shook the whole remaining fabric of the building, crashed to
      earth in an avalanche of stone and brick and flying slates, whilst the
      stairway upon which he had been standing gave a sickening lurch, rocked,
      and fell out sideways into the hall in a smother of dust and plaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stumblingly, those who had been watching groped their way through the
      powdery cloud, as it swirled and eddied, towards the dark blotch at the
      foot of the stairs which was all that could be distinguished of Trent and
      his burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Sara, the momentary silence that ensued was in infinity of nameless
      dread. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're all right," gasped Trent reassuringly, and choked violently as he
      inhaled a mouthful of grit-laden air.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same instant, across the murk shot a broad beam of light from the
      open doorway. Behind it Sara could discern white faces peering anxiously&mdash;Audrey's
      and Miles's, and, behind them again, loomed the heads and shoulders of
      others who had hurried to the scene of the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Herrick's voice rang out, high-pitched with gathering apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you all safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the reassuring answer reached the little throng upon the
      threshold, a murmur of relief went up, culminating in a ringing cheer as
      the news percolated through to the crowd which had collected in the
      roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an amazingly short time, so it seemed to Sara, she found herself
      comfortably tucked into the back seat of Garth's car, between him and
      Molly. Judson, with Jane beside him, took the wheel, and they were soon
      speeding swiftly away towards Greenacres, where Audrey had insisted that
      the homeless household must take refuge&mdash;the remainder of the party
      following in the Herricks' limousine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a night of adventure, but it was over at last, and, as Jane
      Crab remarked with stolid conviction&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor&mdash;blessed saint!&mdash;was never intended to be killed by
      one of they 'Uns, so they might as well have saved theirselves the trouble
      of trying it&mdash;and we'd all have slept the easier in our beds!"

      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RECKONING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Elisabeth came slowly out of the room where her son was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reached Greenacres&mdash;in response to Sara's letter, posted on
      the eve of the raid&mdash;late in the afternoon of the following day, and
      Audrey had at once taken her upstairs to see Tim and left them together.
      And now, as she closed the door of his room behind her, she leaned
      helplessly against the wall and her lips moved in a whispered cry of
      poignant misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maurice! . . . Maurice saved him! . . . Oh, my God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes&mdash;the beautiful, hyacinth eyes&mdash;stared strickenly in
      front of her, wide and horrified like the eyes of a hunted thing, and her
      hands were twisted and wrung beneath the stress of the overwhelming
      knowledge which Tim had so joyously prattled out to her. She could hear
      him now, boyishly enthusiastic, extolling Garth with the eager, unstinted
      hero-worship of youth, and every word he said had pierced her like the
      stab of a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If ever a chap deserved the V.C., Trent does, by Jove! It was the bravest
      thing I've ever known, mother mine, for he told me afterwards, he never
      expected that the top story would hold out till he got me away. He'd seen
      it from the outside first, you know! And there was I, held up with this
      confounded ankle, <i>and</i> with a whole heap of plaster and a brick or
      two sitting on my chest I thought I'd gone west that time, for a
      certainty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tim chuckled delightedly, blissfully unconscious that with each word
      he spoke he was binding upon his mother's shoulders an insuperable burden
      of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Garth Trent who had saved her son&mdash;Garth Trent, to whom she
      owed all the garnered happiness of her married life, yet whose own life's
      fabric she had pulled down about his ears! And now, to the already
      overwhelming magnitude of her debt to him, he had added this&mdash;this
      final act of sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an almost superhuman effort, Elisabeth had forced herself to listen
      quietly to Tim's account of his rescue from the shattered upper story of
      the Selwyn's house&mdash;to listen precisely as though Garth's share in
      the matter held no particular significance for her beyond the splendid one
      it must inevitably hold for any mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, safe from the clear-sighted glance of Tim's blue eyes, she let
      the mask slip from her and crouched against his door in uncontrollable
      agony of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sin which she had sinned in secret&mdash;which, sometimes, she had
      almost come to believe was not a sin, so beautiful had been its fruit&mdash;revealed
      itself to her now in all its naked ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking backward, down the vista of years, the whole structure of her
      happiness appeared in its true perspective, reared upon a lie&mdash;upon
      that same lie which had blasted Garth Trent's career and sent him out,
      dishonoured, from the company of his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this man from whom she had taken faith, and hope, and good repute&mdash;everything,
      in fact, that makes a man's life worth having&mdash;had given her the life
      of her son!
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her face between her hands with a low moan. It was horrible&mdash;horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, afraid that Tim might hear her, she passed stumblingly into her own
      room at the end of the corridor, and there, in solitude and darkness, she
      fought out the battle between her desire still to preserve the secret she
      had guarded three-and-twenty years, and the impulse toward atonement which
      was struggling into life within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a scourge the knowledge of her debt to Garth drove her before it,
      beating her into the very depths of self-abasement, but, even so, her
      pride of name, and the mother-love which yearned to shield her son from
      all that it must involve if she should now confess the sin of her youth,
      urged her to let the present still keep the secrets of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habit of years, the very purpose for which she had worked, and lied,
      and fought, must be renounced if she were to make atonement. A tale that
      was unbelievably shameful must be revealed&mdash;and Tim would have to
      know all that there was to be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Elisabeth, this was the most bitter thing she had to face&mdash;the
      fact that Tim, for whose sake she had so strenuously guarded her secret,
      must learn, not only what was written on that turned-down page of life,
      but also what kind of woman his mother had proved herself&mdash;how
      totally unlike the beautiful conception which his ardent boyish faith in
      her had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he understand? Would he ever understand&mdash;and forgive?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      VINDICATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Herricks and their guests&mdash;"Audrey's refugees," as
      Molly elected to describe the latter, herself included&mdash;had gathered
      round the fire in the library, and were chatting desultorily while they
      awaited Elisabeth's return from her visit to Tim's sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The casualties of the previous evening had been found to be augmented by
      two, since Mrs. Selwyn had remained in bed throughout the day, under the
      impression that she was suffering from shock, whilst Garth Trent was
      discovered to have dislocated his shoulder, and had been compelled to keep
      his room by medical orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In endeavouring to shield Tim, as they crashed to the ground together from
      the tottering staircase, Trent had fallen undermost, receiving the full
      brunt of the fall; and a dislocated shoulder and a severe shaking, which
      had left him bruised and sore from head to foot, were the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characteristically, he had maintained complete silence about his injury,
      composedly accompanying Sara back to Greenacres in his car, and he had
      just been making his way out of the house when he had quietly fainted away
      on to the floor. After which, the Herricks had taken over command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," remarked Molly pertinently, "you might as well turn Greenacres
      into an annexe to the 'Convalescent,' Audrey. You've got four cases
      already."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lavender Lady glanced up smilingly from one of the khaki socks which,
      in these days, dangled perpetually from her shining needles, and into
      which she knitted all the love, and pity, and tender prayers of her simple
      old heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Trent is better," she announced with satisfaction. "I had tea
      upstairs with him this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," supplements Selwyn, "I fancy one of your patients has struck,
      Audrey. Trent intends coming down this evening. Judson has just come back
      from Far End with some fresh clothes for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audrey turned hastily to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens, Miles! We can't let him come down! Mrs. Durward will be
      here with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"&mdash;placidly from Herrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! It will be anything but well!" retorted Audrey significantly. "Have
      you forgotten what happened that day in Haven Woods? I'm not going to have
      Garth hurt like that again! He may have been cashiered a hundred times&mdash;I
      don't care whether he was or not!&mdash;he's a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A very charming smile broke over Miles's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've always known it," he said quietly. "And&mdash;I should think Mrs.
      Durward knows it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I know it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The low, contralto tones that answered were Elisabeth's. Unnoticed, she
      had entered the room and was standing just outside the little group of
      people clustered round the hearth&mdash;her slim, black-robed figure, with
      its characteristic little air of stateliness, sharply defined in the ruddy
      glow of the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden tremor of emotion seemed to ripple through the room. The
      atmosphere grew tense, electric&mdash;alert as with some premonition of
      coming storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men had risen to their feet, but no one spoke, and the brief
      rustle of movement, as every one turned instinctively towards that
      slender, sable figure, whispered into blank silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Miles, infinitely compassionate, there seemed something symbolical in
      the figure of the woman standing there&mdash;isolated, outside the
      friendly circle of the fireside group, standing solitary at the table as a
      prisoner stands at the bar of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firelight, flickering across her face, revealed its pallor and the
      burning fever of her eyes, and drew strange lights from the heavy chestnut
      hair that swathed her head like a folded banner of flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long moment she stood silently regarding the ring of startled faces
      turned towards her. Then at last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have something to tell you," she said, addressing herself primarily, it
      seemed, to Miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she recognized the compassionate spirit of understanding which was
      his in so great a measure and appealed to it unconsciously. Selwyn, with
      sensitive perception, turned as though to leave the room, but she stopped
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't go," she said quickly. "Please stay&mdash;all of you. I&mdash;I
      wish you all to hear what I have to say." She spoke very composedly, with
      a curious submissive dignity, as though she had schooled herself to meet
      this moment. "It concerns Garth Trent&mdash;at least, that is the name by
      which you know him. His real name is Maurice&mdash;Maurice Kennedy, and he
      is my cousin, Lord Grisdale's younger son. He has lived here under an
      assumed name because&mdash;because"&mdash;her voice trembled a little,
      then steadied again to its accustomed even quality&mdash;"because I ruined
      his life. . . . The only way in which I can make amends is by telling you
      the true facts of the Indian Frontier episode which led to Maurice's
      dismissal from the Army. He&mdash;ought never to have been&mdash;cashiered
      for cowardice."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and with a sudden instinctive movement Sara grasped Selwyn's
      arm, while the sharp sibilance of her quick-drawn breath cut across the
      momentary silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Elisabeth repeated. "Maurice ought never to have been cashiered. He
      was absolutely innocent of the charge against him. The real offender was
      Geoffrey . . . my husband. It was he&mdash;Geoffrey, not Maurice&mdash;who
      was sent out in charge of the reconnaissance party from the fort&mdash;and
      it was he whose nerve gave way when surprised by the enemy. Maurice kept
      his head and tried to steady him, but, at the time, Geoffrey must have
      been mad&mdash;caught by sudden panic, together with his men. Don't judge
      him too hardly"&mdash;her voice took on a note of pleading&mdash;"you must
      remember that he had been enduring days and nights of frightful strain,
      and that the attack came without any warning . . . in the darkness. He had
      no time to think&mdash;to pull himself together. And he lost his head. . .
      . Maurice did his best to save the situation. Realizing that for the
      moment Geoffrey was hardly accountable, he deliberately shot him in the
      leg, to incapacitate him, and took command himself, trying to rally the
      men. But they stampeded past him, panic-stricken, and it was while he was
      storming at them to turn round and put up a fight that&mdash;that he was
      shot in the back." She faltered, meeting the measureless reproach in
      Sara's eyes, and strickenly aware of the hateful interpretation she had
      put upon the same incident when describing it to her on a former occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, she seemed to lose her composure, rocking a little
      where she stood and supporting herself by gripping the edge of the table
      with straining fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one stirred. In poignant silence they awaited the continuance of
      the tale which each one sensed to be developing towards a climax of
      inevitable calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afterwards," pursued Elisabeth at last, "at the court-martial, two of the
      men gave evidence that they had seen Geoffrey fall wounded at the
      beginning of the skirmish&mdash;they did not know that it was Maurice who
      had disabled him intentionally&mdash;so that he was completely exonerated
      from all blame, and the Court came to the conclusion that, the command
      having thus fallen to Maurice, he had lost his nerve and been guilty of
      cowardice in face of the enemy. Geoffrey himself knew nothing of the
      actual facts&mdash;either then or later. He had gone down like a log when
      Maurice shot him, striking his head as he fell, and concussion of the
      brain wiped out of his mind all recollection of what had occurred in the
      fight prior to his fall. The last thing he remembered was mustering his
      men together in readiness to leave the fort. Everything else was a blank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the shadows of the fire-lit room came a muttered question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." Elisabeth bent her head in answer. "There was&mdash;other evidence
      forthcoming. But not then, not at the time of the trial. Then Maurice was
      dismissed from the Army."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to speak with ever-increasing difficulty, and her hand went up
      suddenly to her throat. It was obvious that this self-imposed disclosure
      of the truth was taking her strength to its uttermost limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better tell you the whole story&mdash;from the beginning," she
      said, at last, haltingly, and, after a moment's hesitation, she resumed in
      the hard, expressionless voice of intense effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before Maurice went out to India, he and I were engaged to be married. On
      my part, it would have been only a marriage of convenience, for I was not
      in love with him, although I had always been fond of him in a cousinly
      way. There was another man whom I loved&mdash;the man I afterwards
      married, Geoffrey Lovell&mdash;" for an instant her eyes glowed with a
      sudden radiance of remembrance&mdash;"and he and I became secretly
      engaged, in spite of the fact that I had already promised to marry
      Maurice. I expect you think that was unforgivable of me," she seemed to
      search the intent faces of her little audience as though challenging the
      verdict she might read therein; "but there was some excuse. I was very
      young, and at the time I promised myself to Maurice I did not know that
      Geoffrey cared for me. And then&mdash;when I knew&mdash;I hadn't the
      courage to break with Maurice. He and Geoffrey were both going out to
      India&mdash;they were in the same regiment&mdash;and I kept hoping that
      something might happen which would make it easier for me. Maurice might
      meet and be attracted by some other woman. . . . I hoped he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent for a moment, then, gathering her remaining strength
      together, as it seemed, she went on relentlessly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something did happen. Maurice was cashiered from the Army, and I had a
      legitimate reason for terminating the engagement between us. . . . Then,
      just as I thought I was free, he came to tell me his case would be
      reopened; there was an eye-witness who could prove his innocence, a
      private in his own regiment. I never knew who the man was"&mdash;she
      turned slightly at the sound of a sudden brusque movement from Miles
      Herrick, then, as he volunteered no remark, continued&mdash;"but it
      appeared he had been badly wounded and had only learned the verdict of the
      court-martial after his recovery. He had then written to Maurice, telling
      him that he was in a position to prove that it was not he, but Geoffrey
      Lovell who had been guilty of cowardice. When I understood this, and
      realized what it must mean, I confessed to Maurice that Geoffrey was the
      man I loved, and I begged and implored him to take the blame&mdash;to let
      the verdict of the court-marital stand. It was a horrible thing to do&mdash;I
      know that . . . but think what it meant to me! It meant the honour and
      welfare of the man I loved, as opposed to the honour and welfare of a man
      for whom I cared comparatively little. Maurice was not easy to move, but I
      made him understand that, whatever happened now, I should never marry him&mdash;that
      I should sink or swim with Geoffrey, and at last he consented to do the
      thing I asked. He accepted the blame and went away&mdash;to the Colonies,
      I believe. Afterwards, as you all know, he returned to England and lived
      at Far End under the name of Garth Trent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the tale Elisabeth unfolded, and the hushed listeners, keyed up
      by its tragic drama, could visualize for themselves the scene of that last
      piteous interview between Elisabeth and the man who had loved her to his
      own utter undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still a very lovely woman, and it was easy to realize how
      well-nigh bewilderingly beautiful she must have been in her youth, easy to
      imagine how Garth&mdash;or Maurice Kennedy, as he must henceforth be
      recognized&mdash;worshipping her with a boy's headlong passion, had agreed
      to let the judgment of the Court remain unchallenged and to shoulder the
      burden of another man's sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably he felt that, since he had lost her, nothing else mattered, and,
      with the reckless chivalry of youth, he never stopped to count the cost.
      He only knew that the woman he loved, whose beauty pierced him to the very
      soul, so that his vision was blurred by the sheer loveliness of her,
      demanded her happiness at his hands and that he must give it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you think there was no excuse for what I did," Elisabeth
      concluded, with something of appeal in her voice. "But I did not realize,
      then, quite all that I was taking from Maurice. I think that much must be
      granted me. . . . But I make no excuse for what I did afterwards. There is
      none. I did it deliberately. Maurice had won the woman Tim wanted, and I
      hoped that if he were utterly discredited, Sara would refuse to marry him,
      and thus the way would be open to Tim. So I made public the story of the
      court-martial which had sentenced Maurice. Had it not been for that, I
      should have held my peace for ever about his having been cashiered. I&mdash;I
      owed him that much." She was silent a moment. Presently she raised her
      head and spoke in harsh, wrung accents. "But I've been punished! God saw
      to that. What do you think it has meant to me to know that my husband&mdash;the
      man I worshipped&mdash;had been once a coward? It's true the world never
      knew it . . . but I knew it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The agony of pride wounded in its most sacred place, the suffering of love
      that despises what it loves, yet cannot cease from loving, rang in her
      voice, and her haunted eyes&mdash;the eyes which had guarded their secret
      so invincibly&mdash;seemed to plead for comfort, for understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Miles who answered that unspoken supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you need never feel shame again," he said very gently. "Major
      Durward's splendid death has more than wiped out that one mistake of his
      youth. Thank God he never knew it needed wiping out."
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary tranquility came into Elisabeth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered simply. "No, he never knew." Then the tide of bitter
      recollection surged over her once more, and she continued passionately:
      "Oh yes, I've been punished! Day and night, day and night since the war
      began, I've lived in terror that the fear&mdash;his father's fear&mdash;might
      suddenly grip Tim out there in Flanders. I kept him out of the Army&mdash;because
      I was afraid. And then the war came, and he had to go. Thank God&mdash;oh,
      thank God!&mdash;he never failed! . . . I suppose I am a bad woman&mdash;I
      don't know . . . I fought for my own love and happiness first, and
      afterwards for my son's. But, at least, I'm not bad enough to let Maurice
      go on bearing . . . what he has borne . . . now that he has saved Tim's
      life. He has given me the only thing . . . left to me . . . of value in
      the whole world. In return, I can give him the one thing that matters to
      him&mdash;his good name. Henceforth Maurice is a free man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>What</i> are you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp, staccato question cut across Elisabeth's quiet, concentrated
      speech like a rapier thrust, snapping the strained attention of her
      listeners, who turned, with one accord, to see Kennedy himself standing at
      the threshold of the room, his eyes fastened on Elisabeth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his glance composedly; on her lips a queer little smile which held
      an indefinable pathos and appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am telling them the truth&mdash;at last, Maurice," she said calmly. "I
      have told them the true story of the court-martial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you have told them <i>that</i>?" he stammered. He was very
      pale. The sudden realization of all that her words implied seemed to
      overwhelm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." She rose and moved quietly to the door, then face to face with
      Kennedy, she halted. Her eyes rested levelly on his; in her bearing there
      was something aloofly proud&mdash;an undiminished stateliness, almost
      regal in its calm inviolability. "They know&mdash;now&mdash;all that I
      took from you. I shall not ask your forgiveness, Maurice . . . I don't
      expect it. I sinned for my husband and my son&mdash;that is my only
      justification. I would do the same again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively Maurice stood aside as she swept past him, her head unbowed,
      splendid even in her moment of surrender&mdash;almost, it seemed, unbeaten
      to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was a silence&mdash;palpitant, packed with conflicting
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a little choking sob, Sara ran across the room to Maurice and
      caught his hands in hers, smiling whilst the tears streamed down her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!" she cried brokenly. "Oh, my dear!"

     HARVEST

     "There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live
           as before;
     The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;
     What was good, shall be good, with, for evil,
           So much good more . . ."

     BROWNING.
</pre>
    <p>
      "How can you prove it, Garth&mdash;Maurice, I mean?"&mdash;Selwyn
      corrected himself with a smile. "You'll need more than Mrs. Durward's
      confession to secure official reinstatement by the powers that be."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clamour of joyful excitement and wonder and congratulation had spent
      itself at last, the Lavender Lady had shed a few legitimate tears, and now
      Selwyn voiced the more serious aspect of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Herrick who made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the necessary proofs," he said quietly. He had crossed to a bureau
      in the corner of the room, and now returned with a packet of papers in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These," he pursued, "are from my brother Colin, who is farming in
      Australia. He was a good many years my senior&mdash;and I've always
      understood that he was a bit of a ne'er-do-well in his younger days.
      Ultimately, he enlisted in the Army as a Tommy, and in that scrap on the
      Indian Frontier he was close behind Maurice and saw the whole thing. He
      got badly wounded then, and was dangerously ill for some time afterwards,
      so it happened that he knew nothing about the court-martial till it was
      all over. When he recovered, he wrote to Maurice, offering his evidence,
      and"&mdash;smiling whimsically across at Kennedy&mdash;"received a haughty
      letter in reply, assuring him that he was mistaken in the facts and that
      the writer did not dispute the verdict of the court. My brother rather
      suspected some wild-cat business, so before he went to Australia, some
      years later, he placed in my hands properly witnessed documents containing
      the true facts of the matter, and it was only when, through Mrs. Durward,
      we learned that Maurice had been cashiered from the Army, that the
      connection between that and the Frontier incident flashed into my mind as
      a possibility. I had heard that the Durwards' name had been originally
      Lovell&mdash;and I began to wonder if Garth Trent's name had not been
      originally"&mdash;with a glint of humour in his eyes&mdash;"Maurice
      Kennedy! Here's my brother's letter"&mdash;passing it to Sara, who was
      standing next him&mdash;"and here's the document which he left in my care.
      I've had 'em both locked away since I was seventeen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara's eyes flew down the few brief lines of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidently the young fool wishes to be thought guilty," Colin Herrick had
      written. "Shielding his pal Lovell, I suppose. Well, it's his funeral, not
      mine! But one never knows how things may pan out, and some day it might
      mean all the difference between heaven and hell to Kennedy to be able to
      prove his innocence&mdash;so I am enclosing herewith a properly attested
      record of the facts, Miles, in case I should send in my checks while I'm
      at the other side of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, however, Colin still lived and prospered in
      Australia, so that there would be no difficulty in proving Maurice's
      innocence down to the last detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean," Sara appealed to Miles incredulously, "do you mean&mdash;that
      there were these proofs&mdash;all the time? And you&mdash;<i>you knew</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herrick wasn't to blame," interposed Maurice hastily, sensing the
      horrified accusation in her tones. "I forbade him to use those papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles looked at her and a light kindled in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you're marrying a chivalrous, quixotic fool. Maurice refused to
      let me show these proofs because, on the strength of his promise to shield
      Geoffrey Lovell, Elisabeth had married and borne a son. Not even though it
      meant smashing up his whole life would he go back on his word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garth! Garth!" The name by which she had always known him sprang
      spontaneously from Sara's lips. Her voice was shaking, but her eyes, likes
      Herrick's, held a glory of quiet shining. "How could you, dear? What
      madness! What idiotic, glorious madness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how I could have done anything else," said Maurice simply.
      "Elisabeth's whole scheme of existence was fashioned on her trust in my
      promise. I couldn't&mdash;afterwards, after her marriage and Tim's birth&mdash;suddenly
      pull away the very foundation on which she had built up her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively Sara slipped her hand into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad&mdash;<i>glad</i> you couldn't, dear," she whispered. "It would
      not have been my Garth if you could have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand in silence. A curious lassitude was stealing over him.
      He had borne the heat and burden of the day, and now that the work was
      done and there was nothing further to fight for, nothing left to struggle
      and contend against, he was conscious of a strange feeling of frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed almost as though the long agony of those years of
      self-immolation had been in vain&mdash;a useless sacrifice, made
      meaningless and of no account by the destined march of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt vaguely baulked and disillusioned&mdash;bewildered that a man's
      aim and purpose, which in its accomplishing had cost so immeasurable a
      price&mdash;crushing the whole beauty and savour out of life&mdash;should
      suddenly be destroyed and nullified. In the light of the present, the past
      seemed futile&mdash;years that the locust had eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief when presently some one broke in upon the confused turmoil
      of his thoughts with a message from Tim. He was asking to see both Sara
      and Maurice&mdash;would they go to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they went up to his room&mdash;Maurice still with that look of
      grave perplexity upon his face which his somewhat bitter reflections had
      engendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager, boyish face on the pillow flushed a little as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother has told me everything," he said simply, going straight to the
      point. "It's&mdash;it's been rather a facer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice pointed to the narrow ribbon&mdash;the white, purple, white of the
      Military Cross&mdash;upon the breast of the khaki tunic flung across a
      chair-back&mdash;a rather disheveled tunic, rescued with other odds and
      ends from the wreckage of Tim's room at Sunnyside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It needn't be, Tim," he said, "with that to your credit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim's eyes glowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it&mdash;that's what I wanted to see you for," he said. "I
      hope you won't think it cheek," he went on rather shyly, "but I wanted you
      to know that&mdash;that what you did for my mother&mdash;assuming the
      disgrace, I mean, that wasn't yours&mdash;hasn't been all wasted. What
      little I've done&mdash;well, it would never have been done had I known
      what I know now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it would," Maurice dissented quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Had my father been cashiered&mdash;for cowardice"&mdash;he stumbled a
      little over the words&mdash;"the knowledge of it would have knocked all
      the initiative out of me. I should have been afraid of showing the white
      feather. . . . The fear of being afraid would have been always at the back
      of me." He paused, then went on quickly: "And I think it would have been
      the same with Dad. It&mdash;it would have broken him. He could never have
      fought as he did with that behind him. You've . . . you've given two men
      to the country. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, boyishly embarrassed, a little overwhelmed by his own big
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly to Maurice, all that had been dark and obscure grew clear in
      the white shining of the light that gleamed down the track of those lost
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful and ordered issue was revealed. Out of the ruin and bleak
      suffering of the past had sprung the flaming splendour of heroic life and
      death&mdash;a glory of achievement that, but for those arid years of
      silence, had been thwarted and frustrated by the deadening knowledge of
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kindling to the recognition of new and wonderful significances, his eyes
      sought those of the woman who loved him, and in their quiet radiance he
      read that she, too, had understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her, as for him, the dark places had been made light, and with
      quickened vision she perceived, in all that had befallen, the fulfilling
      of the Divine law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands went out to him, and the grave happiness deepened in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, no love&mdash;no sacrifice is ever wasted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very simply, very confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
